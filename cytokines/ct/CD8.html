<h1>CD8</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>This cell surface antigen is known also as T8, Leu2, Lyt2 or OKT8. CD8 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. </p>
<p>CD8 occurs either as a disulfide-linked homodimer or homomultimer of two 34 kDa subunits (CD8-alpha = CD8a = Lyt2, Ly2, OX8) or as a heterodimer complexed with another protein named CD8-beta (= CD8b = Lyt3, Ly3) of which there are multiple forms arising by alternative splicing of its mRNA. Alternative splicing may lead also to the synthesis of a secreted form of CD8-alpha which may form homodimers also. Devine et al (2000) have reported that human CD8-beta, but not mouse CD8-beta, can be expressed in the absence of CD8-alpha as a beta beta homodimer. </p>
<p>The human genes encoding CD8-alpha (approximately 8 kb, 6 exons) and CD8-beta map to chromosome 2p12, lying in close proximity to each other. These genes are linked closely also to the immunoglobulin kappa light chain cluster. </p>
<p>Progenitors of T-cells in the thymus initially do not express CD8 and another antigen called CD4 and develop into mature T-cells in several steps. Immature thymocytes later coexpress CD8 and CD4, and these cells give rise to mature T-cells, which are either CD4(+) CD8(-) or CD4(-) CD8(+) (see also DN1 cells, DN2 cells, DN3 cells). Those T-cells that recognize self-MHC are selected to mature by a process known as positive selection in which MHC class 1 generates an instructive signal that directs differentiation to a CD8 lineage. </p>
<p> FACS analysis of thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes This graphic shows the results obtained by analyzing fluorescence intensity of thymocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes labelled with fluorescent antibodies directed against CD4 or CD8. Populations of thymocytes contain double-negative (yellow) and double-positive (light blue) cell types while peripheral blood lymphocytes contain no double-positive cells but only single positive or double-negative cells. Arrows indicate increasing fluorescence intensity (log10 fluorescence). </p>
<p> CD8 is required for the development of cytotoxic T-cells but not for the development of T-helper cells. CD8 functions as an adhesion molecule that binds MHC class 1 molecules. Antibodies against CD8 can block the killing activity of cytotoxic cells by inhibiting target cell adhesion. </p>
<p>In CD4(+) cells the expression of CD8 can be induced by IL4. The expression of IL4 in transgenic animals blocks the maturation of T-cells and considerably reduces the population of immature thymocytes expressing both CD4 and CD8, and peripheral T-cells while at the same time greatly enhancing the numbers of CD8(+) mature thymocytes. The proliferation of thymocytes with the marker spectrum CD4(-) CD8(-), CD4(+) CD8(-), CD4(-) CD8(+) is stimulated by IL7 which is therefore an important developmental factor for functionally different subpopulations of T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>CD8 functions as an effector molecule for intracellular signal transduction. In T-lymphocytes CD8 has been found to be associated with tyrosine kinase lck which phosphorylates a number of other cell surface proteins (including CD3) and is involved probably in transducing the intracellular signal when these proteins are bound to their receptors (see also: HT-2 cell line). </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The functional consequences of CD4 expression in a population of class 1-selected CD8(+) lymphocytes have been investigated in a transgenic mouse line in which a CD4 transgene is expressed on a significant fraction of the mature CD8(+) lymphocytes but not in the thymus. CD8(+) lymphocytes expressing the CD4 transgene proliferate in response to allogeneic class 1 and class 2 major histocompatibility complex, whereas CD8(+) cells from control animals proliferate only to allogeneic class 1 gene products. The ability of a T-cell population to react with class 2 allogeneic major histocompatibility complex is therefore determined by the presence of CD4. </p>
<p>CD8(+) cells are cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that are capable of lysing target cells by direct cell contact. These cells play a role in the elimination of virus-infected cells and tumor cells and are also involved in transplant rejection processes. </p>
<p>Transgenic knock-out mice lacking CD8 have been generated by homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells (see: ES cells) and bred with the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-susceptible PL/JH-2u to investigate the role of T-cells expressing the marker CD8 in this model of multiple sclerosis. The disease onset and susceptibility were similar to those of wild-type mice. However, the mutant mice had a milder acute EAE, reflected by fewer deaths, but more chronic EAE, reflected by a higher frequency of relapse. This suggests that T-lymphocytes expressing CD8 may participate as both effectors and regulators in this animal model (for a role of CD8(+) cells in parasitemia see also: Beta-2-Microglobulin. </p>
