<h1>LAK%20cells</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>[lymphokine-activated killer cells] These cells constitute a subpopulation of peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells that are collected from tumor patients and expanded in vitro by treatment with IL2. The cells are being referred to also as T-LAK cells (referring to the fact that they have been induced from T-cells and have a T-cell phenotype). Higher yields of LAK cells may be obtained by treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with lectin and then with recombinant IL2 (LILAK cells). </p>
<p>LAK cells develop a broad range of lytic activity against fresh tumor cells and cultured tumor cell lines. Approximately 10**10 autologous ex vivo-activated LAK cells are re-infused into tumor patients for the treatment of various tumors (see: Adoptive immunotherapy). </p>
<p>Approximately 90 % of the LAK cells are derived from precursor cells with the immunological marker spectrum CD3(-), CD11(+), CD14(-), CD16(+), CD56(+). Following their activation they carry the markers CD2(+), CD3(-), CD56(+) and hence are activated NK-cells. These cells are being referred to also as NK-LAK cells (referring to the fact that they have been induced from NK-cells and have an NK-cell phenotype). IL2 activation also induces a significant increase in the expression of the CD25 antigen which functions as an IL2 receptor. LAK cells also express a biochemically uncharacterized cell surface antigen called LAK-1. LAK cells display an MHC-unrestricted cytolysis against a wide variety of fresh and cultured tumor cells. </p>
<p>The molecular basis of the interactions between LAK cells and their target cell has not yet been elucidated in detail. Binding to target cells involves Fc receptors on the LAK cell and several other receptors including the complement factor-3 receptor and several intercellular adhesion molecules and their ligands (see also: ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity). CD58 (LFA-3), CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) adhesion molecules are some of the molecules regulating non-specific major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted and CD3/T-cell receptor (TcR)-triggered cytotoxicity. </p>
<p>Some factors effectively mediating the lysis of tumor cells by LAK cells are Perforins (induced by IL2), and Leukalexins, both of which permeabilise cellular membranes. Cell lysis also involves proteolytic enzymes (granzymes) and cytotoxic NK-cell factors such as NKCF (Natural killer cytotoxic factor). Some observations suggest in addition to rapid cytolysis, antitumor activities of LAK cells also involve slow-acting cytokine production. They appear to secrete, for example, a cytotoxic factor of approximately 57 kDa into the conditioned medium. A cytotoxic factor found in the membrane fractions of adherent LAK cells is M-CTX. Membrane-bound forms of TNF-alpha may contribute also to cell lysis. </p>
<p>Several protocols have been developed to generate LAK cells and to enhance their cytolytic activities. It appears that many different cytokines and other substances are involved in the initial generation of LAK cell activities either as autocrine or paracrine modulators. </p>
<p>Adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells (abbr. ALAK) are isolated from peripheral blood-derived non-MHC restricted LAK cells by in vitro cultivation of LAK cells on nylon fibres or plastic surfaces. These cells are approximately up to 10-fold more cytotoxic than non-adherent cells. Some of this increased cytotoxicity may be the result of cell activation, which is known to be initiated by mere contact of cells with inert surfaces, and the resulting enhanced production of cytokines. </p>
<p>The aggressiveness of LAK cells can be enhanced also by in vitro treatment with TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha appears to promote the migration of lymphocytes into the tumor (see also TIL, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) while IFN-gamma increases the expression of the major histocompatibility antigens. An increased cytotoxic activity of LAK cells may be obtained also by treatment with IL4. The addition of GM-CSF in the presence of IL2 during the induction of LAK cells has been described also to enhance the number of effector cells with substantial cytotoxic activity. The IL2 induced LAK activity is also significantly upregulated in the presence of cisplatin and FK565 (see also: CsA, cyclosporin A). Purified protein A from Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain in combination with IL2 significantly enhances the cytotoxicity and lytic ability of LAK cells against tumor cells that are sensitive or resistant to NK-cells. Cultivation of LAK cells at higher oxygen concentrations also appears to promote their generation and to enhance their functional activities. L-arginine has been shown to be an essential substrate for optimal generation of LAK cells. Supplemental dietary L-arginine also appears to enhance cytotoxic mechanisms of lymphocytes and to potentiate IL2 immunotherapy. </p>
<p>The use of anti-CD3 antibodies, which are capable also of activating T-cells, in combination with IL2 increases the yields of LAK cells by a factor of 10-1000 over that achieved by IL2 alone. It has been observed that CIK (cytokine induced killer cells) can be generated by use of anti-CD3 antibodies and various cytokines, which are even more cytotoxic than LAK cells. </p>
<p>Factors such as TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and also IL1 can be employed with lower doses of IL2 to generate LAK cells, which are as cytolytic as those obtained by high doses of IL2. The treatment of peripheral lymphocytes and monocytes with IL7 has been shown to stimulate endogenous production of IL2. In addition, IL7 also promotes the CD4(+)-T-cell dependent destruction of tumor cells and appears to induce significant LAK cell activity, either alone or in combination with IL2. IL12 has been observed also to be of importance. It facilitates both non-specific LAK cell activities and specific responses of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and is capable of reducing the amounts of IL2 required for LAK cell generation in vitro. The combination of IL4 and IL12 results in a synergistic proliferative activity (8-fold) in CD56(+) natural killer cells and a marked increase in the cell yields. </p>
<p>LAK cells may play an important role in regulation of monocytes, which are important accessory cells in the activation of T-cells for specific antigen recognition. IL2 can induce LAK cells to downregulate antigen presentation function in monocytes activated by GM-CSF and IL3) but not by IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Several inhibitors of LAK cell activity may play an important role also in limiting the therapeutic efficacy of IL2 and/or LAK cells. in vitro, IL4, TGF-beta, steroids, and also prostaglandin E2, known to stimulate adenylate cyclase, interfere with the generation of LAK cells if added during the activation period. In vivo the activity of LAK cells is inhibited by steroids and suppressor cells. Peripheral blood neutrophils inhibit the cytolytic efficiency of IL2 activated LAK cells in a dose-dependent manner although the conditioned medium of cultured neutrophils does not contain soluble factors eliciting this response. Tumors may produce factors also which inhibit cytokine secretion from LAK cells or may develop other means of escaping the cytolytic activities of LAK cells. It has been observed, for example, that for some unknown reasons natural killer cells of many patients with advanced solid tumors are defective in their ability to respond by proliferation to IL2 even in the presence of exogenously supplied growth factors. In addition, fibrin deposition around tumor and/or effector cells can protect tumor cells from immune destruction also and diminish the efficiency of the cytotoxic LAK/NK-cells. The resistance of some tumor cell types against adoptive immunotherapy appears to be due, at least in part, by the ability of IL2 itself to protect tumor cells expressing the IL2 receptor against LAK activity by an as yet unknown mechanism. </p>
<p>The generation of LAK cells for re-infusion into tumor patients is an exacting and cumbersome task. It has been shown recently that LAK cell activity can be generated also in vivo following, for example, the subcutaneous administration of low doses of IL2 as an alternative to conventional systemic treatment involving continuous intravenous infusion of (highly toxic) high doses of IL2. NK-cell activity appears to be maintained for approximately 6 months after discontinuation of IL2 administration. </p>
<p>For some types of tumors, for example, advanced renal cell carcinoma, a review of cases shows that the use of LAK cells does not lead to higher response rates or to prolonged response duration, progression-free survival or survival. Adoptive transfer of in vitro-generated LAK cells therefore is not necessarily required for the antineoplastic activities of IL2 and an increased efficacy of the IL2 treatment.
