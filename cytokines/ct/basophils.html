<h1>basophils</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>Basophils are a type of bone marrow-derived granulocytes (basophilic granulocytes) that comprise less than 1 % of the circulating leukocytes. The nuclei aqre less heterochromatic than those of other granulocytes and stains with basophilic dyes (see also: basophil cells). These cells contain large irregularly shaped specific granules that often obscure the multilobed nucleus. These specific granules are similar to granules of mast cells in that they contain histamine and a heparin-like compound. </p>
<p>Tissue basophils resemble mast cells although their biochemical and morphological features may differ, depending upon the kind of tissue they reside in. They are differentiated from blood basophils by the fact that they are often twice the size of blood basophils, and have irregular and frequently elongated spindle shapes with cytoplasmic extensions. </p>
<p>Basophils arise from CD34(+) progenitor cells found in cord blood, peripheral blood, and the bone marrow, in particular cells that are CD34(+), express the receptors for IL3 and IL5 and are considered eosinophil basophil progenitors (Boyce et al, 1995). Basophils complete their differentiation within the bone marrow, whereas precursors of mast cells leave the bone marrow and differentiate into mast cells after having invaded connective or mucosal tissues. </p>
<p>Basophils have long been regarded as circulating mast cells and share a number of characteristics with eosinophils but blood basophils and mast cells are distinct hematopoietic cells (Falcone et al, 2000). Mature basophils can be distinguished phenotypically from mast cells. Basophils express the alpha chain of the IL3 receptor, which is not expressed by mast cells. Mast cells erxpress the kit receptor (SCF receptor, which is not expressed, or only weakly, on mature basophils). </p>
<p>Basophils play an important role in inflammatory reactions and as multifunctional effector cells in IgE-mediated reactions and are recruited rapidly to various organs sites during allergic late phase reactions (Charlesworth et al, 1989; Liu et al, 1991; Bascom et al, 1988). They have been identified as antigen-capturing cells that may function as important regulators of humoral immune responses. </p>
<p>Basophils release a plethora of potent inflammatory mediators from their cytoplasmic granules upon appropriate stimulation. This process is called degranulation. Degranulation can be caused by a wide range of signals, including high temperature, mechanical trauma, ionizing, toxins, venoms, proteases, tissue proteases, cationic proteins derived from eosinophils and neutrophils, IgE-dependent mechanisms, or IgE-independent immune mechanisms, for example through complement factors. Low molecular weight mediators include histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes. It is the contents of basophil granules released in response to the presence of allergens that cause increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle spasm, vasodilation, and the clinical symptoms of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Many different factors are involved in the regulation of functional activities of basophils and influence their adhesion properties, migration, localization, proliferation, and phenotype. </p>

For other entries pertaining to hematopoiesis see also the Hematology Dictionary section of this encyclopedia.  Basophils have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
