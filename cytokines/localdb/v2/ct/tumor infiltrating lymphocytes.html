<h1>tumor%20infiltrating%20lymphocytes</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>abbr. TIL (a term with multiple meanings). </p>
<p>Infiltration of ymphocytes into a tumor can be regarded as an expression of host immunity against the tumor, but tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have little (CTIL; c = cytotoxic) or no cytotoxicity. It has been observed that cells resembling TILs, CIK (cytokine induced killer cells), can be generated which are even more cytotoxic. See also: myeloid suppressor cells. </p>
<p>TILs, which in humans include CD4(+) CD8(+) cells, are isolated directly from tumor tissues and can be expanded in vitro by culture in the presence of IL2. Expansion and proliferation of lymphocytes is enhanced significantly in the presence of IL4. These cells, which already recognized the tumor in vivo, are capable of accumulating at the site of the tumor following their re-introduction into the tumor patient. </p>
<p>These cells are activated by the treatment with IL2 and are frequently more aggressive than normal lymphokine activated cells (see also: LAK cells); in the mouse TILs have been shown to be 50 to 100 times more potent than LAK cells. These cells may be suitable to reach and destroy distant metastases. The cytotoxic activities of TILs are enhanced by IFN-gamma. The antitumor activity of TILs in vivo is blocked by TGF-beta. </p>
<p>TILs also are suitable targets for the introduction of cytokine genes as a novel form of cancer therapy (see: Cytokine gene transfer). The tumor targeting nature of TILs creates the possibility of using them as a vehicle to deliver gene products specifically to tumor tissues. </p>
<p>Genetically modified TILs carrying an expressed gene encoding TNF have been used in the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. The anti-tumor activity of murine TILs against modified and unmodified tumor cells has been shown to be increased after introduction of MHC class 1 antigens into tumor cells, and this approach may be of potential significance also as an immunomodulating strategy. For another variant of treatment of tumors with TILs see: LATI (lymphokine-activated tumor inhibition). </p>
