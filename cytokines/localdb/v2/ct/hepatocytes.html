<h1>hepatocytes</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>Hepatocytes, also referred to as liver parenchymal cells (parenchymal hepatic cells, parenchymal liver cells), are specialized epithelial cells that constitute the main functional cells of the liver. The main type of liver cancers developing from hepatocytes are called hepatoma or hepatocarcinoma (see: hepatocellular carcinoma for expression profile). Ground glass hepatocytes, described first by Hadziyannis et al (1973) have a cytoplasm with the appearance of ground glass. Such cells are a hallmark of chronic HBV infections (Popper, 1975), contain HBsAg, and harbour viral pre-S deletion mutants, which can induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative DNA damage (Wang et al, 2003). The presence of pre-S mutants in sera is associatd with a high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (Su et al, 2008). Yang et al (2009) have reported enhanced expression of VEGF in ground glass hepatocytes, which may facilitate progression from preneoplastic hepatocytes to hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic HBV infection. For a specific mode of hepatocyte cell death see also: lipoapoptosis. </p>
<p>Hepatocytes may constitute 60 to 80 % of the mass of the liver tissue. The remaining tissue is made up of non-parenchymal cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and blood cells. Hepatocytes perform critical metabolic, endocrine, and secretory functions, which includes the synthesis of carbohydrates, cholesterol, bile salts, fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, protein synthesis (acute phase proteins, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, albumin, fibrinogen, prothrombin group of clotting factors, lipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, transferrin), as well as the detoxification and/or modification of exogenous and endogenous substances (drugs, insecticides, steroids, conversion of ammonia to urea) (for review see: Kmiec, 2001). While all hepatocytes may be engaged in these major functions, there is evidence that they constitute a heterogeneous population with respect to the expression and regulation of regulatory mediators, having specific expression patterns dependent on their position within the liver. </p>
<p>The terms small hepatocytes (abbr. SHC) or oval cells are used for cells in the adult liver that are organ-specific stem cells or committed progenitor cells (Mitaka et al, 1995) (see also: hepatoblasts). They are the natural progenitors in tissue regeneration, possess plasticity to differentiate into specialized cells in adult tissues, and are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into hepatocytes (Mitaka, 2002). </p>
<p>Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that hepatocytes have the capacity to express many different bioactive mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Expression of most of these mediators is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and a variety of other parameters, including culture conditions in vitro and disease states in vivo. Waring et al (2003), for example, have used microarray analysis to reveal considerable differences in gene expression between hepatocytes in suspension and hepatocytes attached to collagen. Baker et al (2001) have employed parallel expression monitoring of approximately 8700 rat genes to characterize mRNA changes over time in hepatocyte cultures. This study reveals a classic hepatocyte dedifferentiation response, showing time-dependent regulation of phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes. </p>
<p> Hepatocytes have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
