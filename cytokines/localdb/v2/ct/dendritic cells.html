<h1>dendritic%20cells</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>The term dendritic cells pertains to a heterogeneous group of multifunctional leukocytes with different phenotypical and functional differences rather than a distinct cell type (Bodey et al, 1997; Jacobs et al, 2008; for a detailed analysis of expression profiles in mouse and human subpopulations of dendritic cells see also: Robbins et al, 2008). These cells are regenerated continuously from hematopoietic stem cells and have a common progenitor identified as common dendritic progenitor). The term BMDC [bone marrow-derived dendritic cells] refers to such cells as found in the bone marrow. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells exist in at least two states, i.e., as immature dendritic cells and mature dendritic cells. Maturation requires a number of maturation signals (Banchereau et al, 2000; Lutz and Schuler, 2002). </p>
<p>The term myeloid dendritic cells (abbr. often MDC) refers to dendritic cells obtained from myeloid precursor cells. This term is used also to differentiate these cells from another subset of dendritic cells known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (see below). Both cell types represent about 0.2-0.4 % of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in peripheral blood (Krug et al, 2001). </p>
<p>The terms standard dendritic cells or conventional dendritic cells (abbr. cDC) are used frequently to refer to murine CD8-alpha(+) cells expressing high levels of CD11c (Shortman and Liu, 2002) that enter lymph nodes by migrating from peripheral tissues via the lymphatic route. This term is used to distinguish these cells from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (see below). In humans, these cells are identified by BDCA1 and BDCA3 (Narbutt et al, 2004). The term lymph node-resident dendritic cells (abbr. LN-DC) is used as a general term comprising conventional dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. </p>
<p>The term monocyte-derived dendritic cells (abbr. often MoDC) refers to a population of dendritic cells obtain by in vitro maturation from monocytes (see below; see also: dendritic cell-related cells). </p>
<p>The term alpha-Type-1 polarized dendritic cells (abbr. alpha-DC1 cells) refers to a population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells that secrete IL12 and express CCR7 obtained during growth in serum-free medium and treatment with a maturation cocktail containing TNF-alpha, IL1-beta, poly-I:C, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma (Mailliard et al, 2004). Gustafsson et al (2008) have reported that, depending on the maturation protocol, these cells also secrete high amounts of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells are found in the interstitial spaces of many organs (Hart and Fabre, 1981), often in close association with epithelial cells (Holt et al, 1987; Maric et al, 1996). Tissues include the skin (Schuler and Steinman, 1985), airways (Holt et al, 1987, 1990), mucosa (Cook et al, 2000), lymphoid organs (Steinman and Cohn, 1974; Hart and McKenzie, 1988), afferent lymphatics (Drexhage et al, 1979; Knight et al, 1982; Pugh et al, 1983; Bujdoso et al, 1989), circumscribed medullary regions of the thymus (Barclay and Mayrhofer, 1981; Agger et al, 1992), liver portal triads (Matsuno et al, 1996) and sinusoids (Kudo et al, 1997), blood (Van Voorhis et al, 1983). These cells may differ from each other in their maturational states and the different pathways taken in the course of differentiation. In addition, these cells may differ also with respects to individual functions and phenotypes. </p>
<p>The studies of various knock-out mice has provided genetic evidence for the existence of two cell lineages of dendritic cells that develop from myeloid precursors or lymphoid precursors. Lymphoid dendritic cells are lacking in mice carrying mutations in the Ikaros gene (Wu et al, 1997). Mice lacking transcription factor relB are deficient in myeloid dendritic cells but have a normal complement of Langerhans cells, which are considered the epidermal counterpart of myeloid dendritic cells (Wu et al, 1998). Mice lacking expression of TGF-beta-1 lack Langerhans cells but normally possess other subsets of dendritic cells (Wu et al, 1997; Kulkarni et al, 1993; Borkowski et al, 1996; Strobl et al, 1996). Cytokines and growth factors and other mediators acting on dendritic cells to influence development, maturation, and functional capacities have been termed DC-poietins. </p>
<p>There is no single cell surface marker that can be used to identify dendritic cells. Dendritic cells express high levels of MHC class 2 antigens. They do not express surface markers for T-cells (CD3, CD16, CD19, CD28), monocytes (CD14, B-cells (CD19, CD20, immunoglobulins), natural killer cells (CD16, CD56, CD57), granulocytes (CD66b). They express a variety of adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD11c, CD50, CD54, CD58, CD102), and costimulatory molecules, which are upregulated during cell activation (Banchereau et al, 2000). CD86 is expressed predominantly in early phases of dendritic cell maturation. CD80 is expressed mainly on mature cells. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells play an important role in initiating adaptive immune responses by capturing micro-organisms that have entered peripheral mucosal tissues. Subsequently, these cells migrate to secondary lymphoid organs and present the captured and processed antigens to resting T-cells. </p>
<p>Depending upon their anatomical localization, various names are used for dendritic cells. They are known also as veiled cells (or veil cells; dendritic cells in lymph) (Knight et al, 1982; Brand et al, 1993), or reticular cells (Steinman et al, 1997). Human blood contains two subsets of dendritic cells, one immunologically mature and the other immature (O'Doherty et al, 1994). Mature dendritic cells originate from myeloid committed CD34(+) progenitor cells (Caux et al, 1996) (see also: CFU-DC). They can be derived also from CD14(+) monocytes (Romani et al, 1996; Bender et al, 1996). Both cell types develop into dendritic cells in the presence of certain cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL4) (Inaba et al, 1992; Caux et al, 1992) and are known as interstitial dendritic cells. They express CD14, CD68, factor IIIa and are present in the dermis and most organs (Holt, 1993; Nestle et al, 1998; Sallusto et al, 1995). It is thought that these cells migrate to the lymphoid follicles and become follicular dendritic cells. They are called dendritic cells because of their morphology rather than any lineage relationship with dendritic cells. Lymphoid dendritic cells present in blood and lymphoid organs express CD4, CD11c, CD13 CD33, and CD123 (Grouard et al, 1997). A marker of mature dendritic cells is CD83 (Zhou and Tedder, 1996). The term FastDC has been used for dendritic cells obtained with a maturation protocol that accelerates the development and maturation of dendritic cells from monocytes, employing treatment with GM-CSF and IL4, followed by activation with pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL1-beta, IL6, PGE2). These cells express mature dendritic cell surface markers, CCR7, and secrete IL12 upon CD40 ligation in the presence of IFN-gamma. The cells possess full T-cell stimulatory capacity and can be derived from human monocytes within only 48 hours of in vitro culture instead of other protocols that require 7 days of cultivation (Dauer et al, 2003, 2005). </p>
<p>Folliculo-stellate cells (abbr. FSC) are a type of dendritic cells found in the anterior pituitary. </p>
<p>Langerhans cells (epidermal dendritic cells) are dendritic cells maturing under the influence of cytokines (TNF-alpha) from CD34(+) myeloid cells that are CD14(-) (Ito et al, 1999). These cells are capable of activating naive T-cells but cannot activate B-cells. Migratory dendritic cells are those that have migrated out of skin ex vivo. Dermal dendritic cells are specialized cells found in the dermis of the skin. They are more frequent than Langerhans cells, differ in their marker spectrum from other dendritic cell types, and have the same capacity as Langerhans cells to present antigens and to activate T-cells. </p>
<p>Inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells constitute a subset of dendritic cells found exclusively in inflammatory skin lesions. Unlike Langerhans cells, these cells do not contain Birbeck granules. They express CD1a, CD11b and MHC class 2 molecules (Wollenberg et al, 1996). These cells express the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (Schuller et al, 2001), engage in endocytosis via the mannose receptor (Wollenberg et al, 2002), and express Fc-epsilon R1. They are the principal epidermal dendritic cells involved in binding IgE in atopic dermatitis (Wollenberg et al, 1999). </p>
<p>A population of medium-sized mononuclear cells with plasmacytoid features in the T-cell zones of human lymphoid tissues, and in the thymus and lymph nodes of patients with various inflammatory and neoplastic diseases has been shown to express several antigens expressed on myelomonocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. These cells, which lack markers for B-cells and plasma cells have been referred to as plasmacytoid monocytes, T-associated plasma cells, or plasmacytoid T-cells (Lennert and Remmele, 1958; Facchetti et al, 2003) and are the same as natural IFN-producing cells (Colonna et al, 2004). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (abbr. often PDC, and so named for historical reasons referring to histological similarities to antibody-producing plasma cells) (Grouard et al, 1997; Siegal et al, 1999), which are being referred to also as lymphoid-related dendritic cells, are derived from CD34(+) cells committed to the lymphoid lineage. These cells enter lymphoid tissues directly from the blood (Cella et al, 1999). They constitute a subset of dendritic cells that do not express CD11c, are negative for myeloid markers, express high levels of CD45RA and IL3 receptors (IL3RA, interleukin-3 receptor-alpha, IL3R-alpha, common beta, beta c, betac, common cytokine receptor-beta, cytokine receptor common subunit beta, IL3RB, IL3 receptor subunit beta, IL3R-beta, IL3 receptor subunit beta; interleukin-3 receptor-beta, IL5RB, IL5 receptor subunit beta, IL5R-beta, GM-CSF receptor subunit beta, CSF2RB, colony stimulating factor-2 receptor-beta, CD131) and have been shown to express the BST-2 antigen. These cells are identical with a cell type described as natural IFN-producing cells or IFN-producing cells (abbr. NIPC, IPC) (Kadowaki et al, 2000; Cella et al, 1999; Siegal et al, 1999; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al, 1988; Sandberg et al, 1989). Human Germinal center dendritic cells (Grouard et al, 1996) are immature dendritic cells. They express CD11c, CD45R0, CD13, CD33 and are found in within secondary lymphoid organs in areas containing B-cells. Interdigitating cells (see also: interdigitating reticulum cells) (Bjrck et al, 1997; de Saint-Vis et al, 1998; Res et al, 1999) are mature dendritic cells found in areas of peripheral lymphoid organs containing T-cells such as the spleen, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches). These cells express the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (Bjrck et al, 1997) and the specific DC maturation marker DC-LAMP (de Saint-Vis et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Dendritic cells have a short life span. At the various anatomical sites they undergo cell death by apoptosis after a certain time and are replaced by new cells (Holt et al, 1994; Steinman et al, 1974; Kamath et al, 2000; Henri et al, 2001; Schoenberger and Toes, 1998). The mature form of dendritic cells is an end stage of differentiation from which the cells cannot revert into either macrophages or lymphocytes. Dendritic cells are considerably rarer than macrophages but can be obtained in large numbers by ex vivo expansion from CD34(+) bone marrow-derived precursor cells or monocytes (Caux et al, 1996, 1997; Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994; Freudenthal and Steinman, 1990; Thomas et al, 1993; Fong and Engleman, 2000; Syme and Gluck, 2001). Flt-3 ligand (Marakovsky et al, 1996; Pulendran et al, 1997), GM-CSF (Daro et al, 2000; Pulendran et al, 1999), and G-CSF (Arpinati et al, 2000; Pulendran et al, 2000) have been shown to expand distinct subpopulations of dendritic cells in vivo. </p>
<p>Subpopulations of dendritic cells differ in phenotype, functions, and tissue localization (Shortman, 2000; Pulendran et al, 2001). Dendritic cells undergo phenotypic and functional changes during their maturation and migration. Trafficking of dendritic cells to distinct anatomical locations involves the coordinated regulation and expression of chemokines and their receptors (Sozzani et al, 2000) but also of selectins, and integrins (D'Amico et al, 1998). Dendritic cells are not proliferating cells. All cells play an important role in primary and secondary immunological reactions throughout the body. These cells are potent regulators of the immune system by virtue of their ability to present antigens ingested via phagocytosis (Austyn, 1996) or receptor-mediated endocytosis (Sallusto et al, 1995), to induce a primary immune response in resting naive T-cells, and to secrete a plethora of mediators that can affect a variety of other cell types (Lipscomb and Masten, 2002; Cutler et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Dendritic cells can cause cell activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Antigens are captured, processed and presented on the cell surface of dendritic cells together with MHC class 1 to activate CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cells or with MHC class 2 molecules to activate CD4(+) T-helper cells. Dendritic cells are involved also in processes leading to immune tolerance, which involves negative selection of self-reactive T-cells in the thymus (Steinman and Nussenzweig, 2002). Some of the cytokines and factors produced by dendritic cells are critical to the cell activation and differentiation of B-cells. Follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers of lymph nodes are thought to be able to cause long-term stimulation of B-cells, which can take up antigens from these cells and present it to T-cells. </p>
<p>Studies are now in progress to determine the most effective way of using activated dendritic cells pulsed, for example, with autologous tumor lysates, for immunotherapy in human patients (Fong and Engleman, 2000). Dendritic cells are known to secrete exosomes constitutively. These exosomes constitute a membrane vesicle population (60-80 nm) of endocytic origin and bear MHC molecules and a variety of costimulatory proteins, as well as adhesion proteins and a variety of proteins related to apoptosis (Thery et al, 2001). Exosomes resemble apoptotic vesicles but are biochemically and morphologically distinct. Exosomes can induce potent anti-tumor immune responses in vivo in the same way as dendritic cells themselves and can cause rejection of established tumors in mice (Chaput et al, 2003). </p>
<p>Rodent myeloid dendritic cells promote Th2 differentiation (Pulendran et al, 1999; Maldonado-Lopez et al, 1999). Rodent lymphoid dendritic cells are major producers of IL12 and are engaged in Th1 cell responses. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC1 cells; type 1 dendritic cells, called also Th1-inducing dendritic cells, or myeloid-related dendritic cells) induce Th1 cells (Rissoan et al, 1999). Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC2 cells; type 2 dendritic cells), called also Th1-inducing dendritic cells, elicit Th2 cell responses, produce IFN-gamma but no IL12 (Siegal et al, 1999; Cella et al, 1999). Hata et al (2009) have compiled the gene profile dominantly expressed in DC2 cells.  </p>
<p>Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that dendritic cells have the capacity to express many different bioactive mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Expression of some of these proteins is constitutive but expression of most is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, cell activation, stage of differentiation, and/or anatomical localization. In addition, expression may differ among different strains of experimental animals. Frequently, only a subset of dendritic cells may express these proteins (see also my remarks under cell types). For examples of microarray analyses comparing expression patterns of cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins in different subsets of dendritic cells see also: Sun et al (2003), Skelton et al (2003), Grolleau et al (2003), Nagorsen et al (2004); Chen et al, 2001. Chaussabel et al (2003) have compared gene expression profiles in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages generated in vitro from the same individual blood donors and exposed to 5 different pathogens. These analyses demonstrate dendritic cells and macrophages constitutively express approximately 4000 genes, 96% of which are shared between the 2 cell types. Unique expression patterns are found in response to each pathogen. Ishii et al (2005) have identified approximately 2000 genes that are upregulated by stimulation with bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell-wall skeleton. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
