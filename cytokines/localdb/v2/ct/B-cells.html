<h1>B-cells</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>These cells (called also B-lymphocytes, or generally antibody-producing cells; see also: B-2 cells (B-2 B-cells)) are among the most abundant types of white blood cells (lymphocytes). B-cell populations can be divided into different functionally distinct subsets that differ in their differentiation status, their anatomical localisation, and their developmental lineage (Sagaert and De Wolf-Peeters, 2003; Allman and Pillai, 2008) (see also: B-1 cells (B-1 B-cells) (B-1a cells, B-1b cells), monocytoid B-cells, transitional B-cells (T1 B-cells and T1 B-cells), marginal zone B-cells, follicular B-cells, plasma cells). Subpopulations of B-cells can be distinguished also by their status as functionally polarized effector cells defined by the secretion of distinct cytokines (see: Be1 cells, Be2 cells). For benign immature B-cells that commonly populate the bone marrow of children see: Hematogones. For B-cell functions that go beyond immunoglobulin synthesis see also: regulatory B-cells. </p>
<p>An individual's capacity to mount effective immune responses is determined by the diversity of B-cell pools. The development of B-cells begins in the fetal liver and continues in the bone marrow throughout the lifetime of an organism. B-cells mature in the bone marrow and go through a sequence of at least 5 recognizable developmentral stages. </p>
<p>The precursors of mature B-cells go through a series of defined stages in their development that can be distinguished from one another by the absence or presence of various kinds of genome rearrangements in the antibody locus and/or expression of specific antigens or receptors (see also: B-lymphoid precursor cells) (Bryder and Sigvardsson, 2010; Santos and Borghesi, 2011; Nescakova and Bystricky, 2011).  </p>
<p>Progenitor B-cells (Pre-pro-B-cells) express the germline configuration in both immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain antibody locus, do not express antibodies, express the IL7 receptor, and do not express CD19. These CD34(+) stem cells from which B-cells develop do not express recombinase genes (RAG1, RAG2) or TdT, components of the pre-B-cell receptor comlex (Ig alpha-beta), or Btk. B-cell progenitors are CD34(+) cells that develop into B-cells in several developmental stages. Some of these stages have been identified by the expression of cell surface markers. CD34(+) CD19(-) CD10(+) early B-cells develop into CD34(+) CD19(+) CD10(+) B-cell progenitors (pro-B-cells), which develop into CD34(-) CD19(+) CD10(+) B-cell precursors (pre-B-cells). Pre-pre-B-cells can be separated into early Pro-B-cells, which undergo DJ rearrangement at the heavy chain locus, show the germline configuration at the light chain locus, do not express immunoglobulin, express IL7 receptor but no CD19. These cells express recombinase, TdT, CD34, CD45, and class II antigens. Late Pro-B-cells undergo VDJ rearrangement at the heavy chain locus, show the germline configuration at the light chain locus, do not express immunoglobulin, express IL7 receptor and also CD19. Late pro-B-cells also express CD45R, CD40, class II antigens. Large Pre-B-cells are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, show the germline configuration at the light chain locus, express IgM in the cytoplasm, and express IL7 receptor and also CD19. Large pre-B-cells express the mu chain of the pre-B receptor, and do no longer express recombinases and TdT. Small Pre-B-cells do no longer divide and differ from large pre-B-cells in that they are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, undergo VJ rearrangement at the light chain locus, express IgM in the cytoplasm, and express IL7 receptor and also CD19. Immature B-cells are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, VJ-rearranged at the light chain locus, express IgM on the cell surface, do not express IL7 receptors, and express CD19. Immature B-cells re-express recombinases and TdT, express pre-B-cell receptor comlex (Ig alpha-beta), and express Btk. These cells are very sensitive to antigen binding and die if they are exposed to self-antigens in the bone marrow. Mature B-cells are those that did not bind self antigens. They are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, VJ-rearranged at the light chain locus, express IgM and IgD on the cell surface, do not express IL7 receptors, and express CD19. Mature B-cells do not express recombinases and TdT, express pre-B-cell receptor comlex (Ig alpha-beta), and express Btk, CD45R, class II antigens, CD21, and CD40. These cells are mature naive (resting) B-cells. </p>
<p>Each differentiation step appears to be regulated by the expression of distinct transcription factors, receptors, coreceptors, cytokines, and growth factors. Some of the gene expression patterns have been elucidated by utilizing long-term bone marrow cultures, which permit the study of soluble and cell contact signals provided by bone marrow stromal cells and provide information about lineage restriction of developing cells under various conditions. Any abnormalities in the expression of cytokine receptors and/or signal transduction processes can cause functional abnormalities of B-cells. </p>
<p>The various subpopulations of B-cells are distinguished by expression or non-expression of a few CD antigen markers. In mice, immature B-cells are distinguished by high expression of CD24, whereas mature B-cells are characterized by low expression of CD24 (Allman et al, 1992). Innate B-1 cells are identified usually by expression of CD19 and CD5. These cells produce mainly IgM antibodies with low affinities and high cross-reactivity (Kipps, 1989). Conventional B-2 cells are CD19(+) and CD5(-). Transitional B-cells (newly emerging after differentiation and selection in the bone marrow) are CD19(+), CD10(+), CD27(-). Naive B-cells are CD19(+) and CD27(-), and memory B-cells are CD19(+), CD27(+). </p>
<p>Naive B-cells are cells that have not been exposed to antigens yet. They are characterized by a nonproliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype and the expression of various chemokine and cytokine receptors. The first encounter with antigen happens in the T-cell rich areas of secondary lymphoid organs, where they are activated by antigen-specific T-cells and become germinal center founder B-cells. These founders enter the germinal center and become centroblasts that proliferate and mutate their B-cell receptor. The development of centroblasts is associated with the upregulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, DNA-repair, and chromatin remodeling and the acquisition of a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Centroblasts develop into centrocytes, which undergo selection after recognizing and capturing antigens on follicular dendritic cells and the presentation of processed antigen to germinal center T-cells. Centroblasts leave the follicle and pass to the cortex medullary sinuses of lymph nodes, where they become immunoblasts. Immunoblasts can be the precursors of either memory B-cells, or plasma cells, the sole function of which is the production of soluble antibodies. Centroblasts (rapidly dividing cells) and centrocytes (non-dividing cells) represent the two major B-cell subsets present in germinal center. Caron et al (2009) have shown that human centroblasts express CXCR4, and can reliably be distinguished from centrocytes, which do not express the chemokine receptor. </p>
<p>Peripheral lymphoid organs contain three major B-cell compartments. The germinal center contains rapidly proliferating B-cells that undergo selection and affinity maturation. The mantle zone contains naive quiescent B-cells. The marginal zone contains mostly memory B-cells. B-cells residing in these compartments have specific functional roles in humoral immune response and also differ in their expression profiles. </p>
<p>B-cells are highly specialized immune cells that have the capacity to bind to antigenic determinants (epitopes) of a soluble antigen by means of the B-cell receptor (BCR). B-cell receptors are integral membrane proteins that are expressed by B-cells without having been exposed to an antigen ligand. B-cell receptors expressed on a B-cell are specific for a particular epitope, i.e., these receptors have a unique binding site. </p>
<p>Antigen binding causes the B-cells to internalize the antigen in a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis, and to present fragments thereof on the cell surface as a complex with class 2 histocompatibility molecules. These complexes are recognized by T-cell receptors expressed on T-helper cells. Cell-to-cell contact by means of B-cell receptors, T-cell receptors, class 2 histocompatibility molecules, in addition to costimulatory signals, causes T-helper cells to secrete cytokines that lead to cell activation of these B-cells. Repeated exposure to the same epitope and various additional co-stimulatory signals cause cell division, which leads to the emergence of identical clones of B-cells that carry B-cell receptors with identical specificity. Subsequently, these B-cells differentiate into plasma cells, all of which express a soluble version of the original B-cell receptor with unique specificity. These soluble versions of the B-cell receptor are called antibodies and are reactive to almost all potential pathogens. </p>
<p>Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that B-cells have the capacity to express many different bioactive mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. A variety of studies have been published to compare gene expression profiles of normal and malignant B-cells or B-cells lacking specific genes required for their development (Wang et al, 2004; Lindvall et al, 2004; Chtanova et al, 2004; Hoffmann et al, 2003; Ollila and Vihinen, 2003; Klein et al, 2003; van Anken et al, 2003; Hogerkorp et al, 2002; Ek et al, 2002; Islam et al, 2002; Hoffmann et al, 2002; Husson et al, 2002; Klein et al, 2001; Chu and Paul, 1998). </p>
<p>Expression of some of the proteins listed below is constitutive but the expression of most is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, cell activation, stage of differentiation, resting or activated cells, and/or cells residing in different anatomical localization, or the degree of malignancy or association with particular disease states. The following list of mediators makes no distinction between B-cell subsets and/or cells from different anatomical locations, or species etc. </p>
<p>B-cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
