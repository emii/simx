<p> </p>
<p>The term stromal cells is a collective term for all the different supporting cell types found in a given tissue or organ as distinguished from the functional elements of this tissue or organ, the so-called parenchymal cells. Stroma, therefore, is a heterogeneous assortment of different cell types at any given time point, and its composition may also vary considerably over time. See also: stromal cell line. </p>
<p>Note: the term stromal cells is used frequently also to refer to mesenchymal stem cells (Vayssade and Nagel, 2009). In some instances the term interstitial cells is used synonymously with stromal cells.  </p>
