<h1>CCL4</h1>

    <h2>CCL4</h2>
    
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL4 is the new designation of ACT-2. This factor is identical with 744.1, G26, H400, HC21, LAG-1, MIP-1-beta, and SIS-gamma. A previous designation is SCYA4 [small inducible cytokine A4]. </p>
<p>The human genome contains two paralogous genes for the CCL4 chemokine, represented by ACT-2 and LAG-1. These genes are highly homologous, but encode slightly different proteins and also are regulated and expressed differentially. This also suggests that the two genes may not have identical activities. Monocytes express predominantly ACT-2. Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and LAG-1 (Lu et al, 2004). </p>
<p>The protein is known mainly for its activity as a chemotactic cytokine but may have a potential role in host defense as a direct antiviral agent. CCL4 has been reported to show a significant direct antiviral activity against HSV-1. It binds to HSV-1 virions via envelope glycoprotein gB and is capable of generating pores in the envelope of HSV-1 (Nakayama et al, 2006). </p>

    <h2>ACT-2</h2>
    
<p>[Immune activation gene-2] ACT-2 is known also as G26, pAT744, LAG-1, and MIP-1-beta (macrophage inflammatory protein see: MIP). The new designation is CCL4. </p>
<p>The human ACT-2 gene, designated SCYA4 (see also: SCY family of cytokines), maps to chromosome 17q21-q23 (Napolitano et al, 1991). Studies of sequence homology and genome organization have shown that ACT-2 belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines. </p>
<p>ACT-2 is a factor secreted by T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and various tumor cell lines, following cell activation by mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin, bacterial endotoxins or Staphylococcus aureus (Lipes et al, 1988). The synthesis of ACT-2 is stimulated also by IL2, while glucocorticoids, TGF-beta and CsA (cyclosporin A) inhibit the synthesis. </p>
<p>In rats, the subcutaneous injection of the factor precipitates local inflammatory reactions characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils. </p>
<p>The human genome contains two genes for the CCL4 chemokine, represented by ACT-2 and LAG-1. These genes are highly homologous, but encode slightly different proteins and also are regulated and expressed differentially. This also suggests that the two genes may not have identical activities. Monocytes express predominantly ACT-2. Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and LAG-1 (Lu et al, 2004). </p>
<p>This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CCL4.
