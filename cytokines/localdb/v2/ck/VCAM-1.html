    <h2>INCAM-110</h2>
    
<p>[inducible cellular adhesion molecule 110 kDa] Taichman et al (1991) have established the immunological identity of VCAM-1 and INCAM-110. The protein has been given the CD designation CD106. </p>
<p>The protein has been described by Rice and Bevilacqua (1989). Its expression is induced in endothelial cells after stimulation with cytokines. The protein mediates adhesion of melanoma and carcinoma cell lines to vascular endothelial cells (Rice and Bevilacqua, 1989), and also adhesion of lymphocytes (Rice et al, 1990). </p>
