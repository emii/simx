See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL5 is produced by T-cells. For the constitutive synthesis see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>Murine IL5 cDNA encodes a protein of 113 amino acids: the human protein has a length of 115 amino acids. The biologically active form of IL5 is an N-glycosylated antiparallel homodimer linked by disulfide bonds. Monomeric forms are biologically inactive. Variable molecular masses of the native protein are caused by heterogeneous glycosylation. Non-glycosylated IL5 is also biologically active. </p>
<p>Murine and human IL5 are approximately 70 % identical. While murine and human IL5 have the same specific activity on human cells murine IL5 is approximately 50-100-fold more active on murine cells than human IL5. The generation of human/murine chimaeric proteins has revealed that the carboxyterminal end of the protein is re4sponsible for this species specificity. This region probably interacts with the receptor. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL5 gene has a length of approximately 4 kb and contains four exons. It maps to human chromosome 5q23-31 in the vicinity of genes encoding GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL3 and IL4 which all have the same orientation and are located within a 500 kb fragment of DNA. The distance between the IL5 and IL4 gene is approximately 90-240 kb (see also: 5q minus syndrome). The 5' region of the IL5-gene contains several elements, known as CLE (conserved lymphokine element), which are binding sites for transcription factors controlling the expression of this gene (see also: gene expression). </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>High affinity (approximately 30-100/cell) and low affinity (approximately 200-400/cell) receptors for IL5 are expressed in all hematopoietic and lymphoid cells (see also: hematopoiesis). The gene for the human IL5 receptor-alpha subunit maps to chromosome 3p26. </p>
<p>The low affinity receptor (Kdis = 30 nM) has a molecular mass of 50 kDa (p60) (CD125; see also: CD antigens). The cDNA of a cloned murine IL5 receptor encodes a glycoprotein of 415 amino acids containing a secretory signal sequence of 17 amino acids. The extracellular domain of this protein has a length of 322 amino acids. The transmembrane domain has a length of 22 amino acids and the cytoplasmic domain has a length of 54 amino acids. The receptor contains another protein that does not bind IL5. This second subunit is expressed in some IL3 dependent (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) cell lines that do not bind IL5. The introduction of p60 into these cells generates a high affinity IL5 receptor. The second subunit of the IL5 receptor is identical with the larger subunit of the receptor for the colony stimulating factor GM-CSF. This subunit is involved also in the generation of a high affinity receptor for IL3 and is being referred to as common beta (see also: CD131). Soluble forms of the IL5 receptor have been described also. See also the Transgenic /Knock-out/Antisense Studies section of this entry for details on mice not expressing the common beta subunit of the receptor complex. </p>
<p>For a protein involved in signal transduction see also: CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL5 is active in murine cells albeit with greatly reduced biological activity. Murine IL5 is active in human cells. </p>
<p>IL5 is a specific hematopoietic growth factor (see also: Hematopoietins) that is responsible for the growth and differentiation of eosinophils. IL5 promotes the growth of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells BFU-E while it causes differentiation of CFU-E the proliferation of which is inhibited by IL5. IL5 strongly stimulates the proliferation, cell activation, and differentiation of eosinophils. B-cells can be made responsive to IL5 by treatment with suboptimal doses of IL1. </p>
<p>IL5 also promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. In thymocytes IL5 induces the expression of high affinity IL2 receptors. </p>
<p>In contrast to human IL5 murine IL5 also acts on B-cells (see also: BCDF, B-cell differentiation factor). It induces the proliferation of pre-activated B-cells and their differentiation. Murine IL5 also stimulates the production and secretion of IgM and IgA by B-cells stimulated by bacterial endotoxins (see also: Isotype switching). </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of the deregulated expression of IL5 have been studied in transgenic mice expressing the human factor. Mice overexpressing IL5 have a characteristic lifelong continuous blood and spleen eosinophilia and infiltration of eosinophils in lungs and gut but they remain normal and do not show any signs of tissue damage (see also: inflammation, wound healing). In vivo administration of antibodies to murine IL5 receptor inhibits eosinophilia in IL5 transgenic mice. Transgenic mice expressing the IL5 gene under the control of a metallothionein promoter have elevated levels of IL5 in the serum which can be increased further by administration of cadmium. These animals show an increase in the levels of serum IgM and IgA. Treatment with cadmium results in the expansion of a population of Ly1(+) B-cells in the spleen, which have been considered to produce autoantibodies, and which are also selectively developed by IL5 in long-term BMC (bone marrow culture). The serum of these animals also contains elevated concentrations of polyreactive anti-DNA antibodies of IgM class. Studies of immunoglobulin gene usage in IL5 transgenic mice show that IL5 maintains B-cells expressing CD5 that have a fetus-type of immunoglobulin gene usage. IL5 may thus be responsible for prolonging the life span of immature CD5(+) B-cells, which subsequently mature to CD5(-) B-cells that secrete polyreactive natural antibodies. </p>
<p>Robb et al (1995) have created transgenic knock-out mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding the common beta subunit (beta C) of the GM-CSF, IL3, and IL5 receptor complexes. Homozygous deletion mutants exhibit normal development and survive to young adult life. They develop pulmonary peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis. Eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone marrow of homozygous deletion mutants are reduced, while other hematological parameters are normal. Bone marrow cells from homozygous deletion mutants do not show high-affinity binding of GM-CSF, while cells from heterozygous animals show an intermediate number of high-affinity receptors. In clonal cultures of bone marrow cells derived from homozygous deletion mutants, even high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL5 do not stimulate colony formation (see also: Colony formation assay). Differences in the systemic clearance and distribution of GM-CSF between mutant and wild-type littermates are not observed. </p>
<p>Nishinakamura et al (1996) have crossed beta-c mutant mice with mice deficient for IL3. The double-mutant mice lacking all IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 functions are apparently normal and fertile. The animals show the same reduced numbers of eosinophils and a lack of eosinophilic response to parasites as beta-c mutant mice. The immune response of the double mutant mice to Listeria mono-cytogenes is normal. Hematopoietic recovery after treatment with Fluorouracil is also normal. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanism to produce blood cells that do not depend on the presence of IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL5 can be detected in bioassays employing cells that respond to this factor (see: B13; BCL1; T88-M; TALL-103; TF-1). IL5 can be detected also by sensitive immunoassays. Another assay involves the detection of colonies of eosinophils in a colony formation assay (see: EDF, eosinophil differentiation factor) or the detection of eosinophil peroxidase. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>A possible clinical application is suggested by the activity of IL5 on eosinophils. Animal experiments have shown that eosinophilia elicited by nematode infections in mice and the concomitant infiltration of the lung with eosinophils can be prevented by administration of monoclonal animals directed against IL5. </p>
