    <h2>CSF-3</h2>
    
<p>[Colony stimulating factor-3] This factor was described initially as an activity promoting the development of colonies containing granulocytes in a colony formation assay (see also: CSF for general information about colony stimulating factors). </p>
<p>The factor is isolated from cultured murine lung, human T-cell lines, human Hodgkin tumor cell lines, and human fibrous histiocytoma cell lines (Burgess et al, 1977, 1985, 1986; Byrne et al, 1986; Erickson-Miller, 1988). The factor is identical with G-CSF and the designation CSF-3 has been proposed by Pimentel (1990) following the number-based nomenclature for M-CSF (CSF-1) and GM-CSF (CSF-2). </p>

    <h2>CSF</h2>
    
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) cell scattering factors. See: Motogenic cytokines. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) colony stimulating factors </p>
<p>colony stimulating activities, also abbr. CSA. </p>
<p>This term goes back to experiments carried out in the 60ies, which attempted to grow colonies of bone marrow cells immobilized in soft agar or methyl cellulose (see also: Colony formation assay). It was found that Feeder cell layers and also the supplementation of the growth media with conditioned medium considerably promoted colony growth, suggesting the existence of colony stimulating factors secreted by the cells. </p>
<p>While hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis) could be maintained only for short periods of time in the absence of such factors, their presence allowed the development of colonies containing erythroid cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and megakaryocytes (see also: CFU, colony-forming unit). The biochemical analysis of various activities stimulating colony formation supporting the growth and development of these cell types revealed that there existed many different and distinct factors of this sort. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors belong to the group of regulatory proteins and peptides known as cytokines. Many of these factors are either N- or O-glycosylated. Glycosylation has been shown to enhance the solubility, stability and resistance to proteolytic enzymes. It does not appear to be required for the full spectrum of biological activities of these factors (see also: Recombinant cytokines). The genes encoding many of the human colony stimulating factors have been cloned and mapped. Some of the genes are in close vicinity but they do not show great homology among each other with the exception of some conserved regions. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors are produced by many different cell types, including, for example, B-lymphocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, bonemarrow stromal cells, T-lymphocytes. They are synthesized as precursor molecules containing a classical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of approximately 25-32 amino acids (see also: gene expression). </p>
<p>The secreted factors have an extremely high specific biological activity (10**8 - 10**9 units/mg protein) and are, therefore, active at very low concentrations (1-100 pM). These factors are absolutely required for the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The concentrations required for mere maintenance of viability are usually orders of magnitude lower than those required to induce cell proliferation or to elicit specific functional activities of the cells. </p>
<p>The names of the individual factors usually indicate the cell types that respond to these factors. The classical colony stimulating factors include M-CSF (specific for macrophages), G-CSF (specific for granulocytes), GM-CSF (specific for macrophages and granulocytes), IL3 (multifunctional) and MEG-CSA (specific for megakaryocytes). G-CSF and M-CSF are lineage-specific while GM-CSF and IL3 are multifunctional hematopoietic growth factors acting on earlier stages of differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Some of the biological activities of colony stimulating factors are concentration-dependent, i.e., biological activities may differ depending upon whether low or high concentrations of the corresponding factors act on the cells. In addition, the activities of many of these factors can be synergised and antagnoized by other factors. </p>
<p>Factors such as Epo, which is involved in erythropoiesis, but also most of the factors known as Interleukins, are not classified as colony stimulating factors. In combination with colony-forming factors they constitute the group of so-called hematopoietins (hematopoietic growth factors). </p>
<p>The synthesis of colony stimulating factors can be stimulated by immunological reactions and products of infectious agents. In some cell types their synthesis can be stimulated by a factor of up to 1000. The induction of synthesis may be direct or a consequence of the activity of other hematopoietic factors. The synthesis of IL1, for example, is induced by bacterial endotoxins or foreign antigens, and IL1, in turn, is capable of stimulating the synthesis of various colony stimulating factors. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors may act as differentiation factors initiating the irreversible terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Colony stimulating factors also induce the synthesis of many other growth factors and play an important role in the maintenance of membrane integrity and cell viability. The proliferation of mature cells is usually not influenced by these factors, they may, however, prolong their life span. Apart from their actions on a number of hematopoietic cell types colony stimulating factors also influence other cell types. </p>
<p>The stimulation of hematopoietic cells in particular by colony stimulating factors is the basis of their clinical use in patients suffering from diverse forms of hematopoietic disorders. The use of molecular biological techniques, culminating in the cloning and expression of the genes encoding the colony stimulating factors has been instrumental in this development. Most of these factors are now available in highly purified form and in sufficient amounts allowing an assessment of their therapeutical efficacy and their use in the clinic (see also: Recombinant cytokines. </p>
<p>The use of these mediators opens ways of reconstituting aberrant hematopoietic processes in a physiological manner. This includes more or less all varieties of disorders, which are characterized either by an insufficient maturation of blood cells or by a reduced production of leukocytes. The fact that different cell types vary in their responses to individual colony stimulating factors can be used to expand differentially defined populations of progenitor cells. On the one hand, these factors can be used to correct chemotherapy induced cytopenias. Colony stimulating factors can be used to counteract cytopenia-related predisposition to infections and hemorrhages. Since these factors are capable also of influencing the growth cycle of many malignant cell types, many of them showing at least tumoricidal activities, colony stimulating factors may be used also in the directed treatment of various cancers either alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs. </p>
<p>The major advantage of treatments involving the use of colony stimulating factors is certainly the more or less physiological reconstitution of hematopoietic processes. So far there are no indications that treatments with these factors lead to an exhaustion of the normal stem cell population in the bone marrow or to the proliferation on non-myeloid tumors (see also: hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p>A novel concept is the so-called peripheral stem cell separation. This technique involves the expansion of peripheral stem cells by in vivo pretreatment with suitable colony stimulating factors and their subsequent collection. These cells can be re-infused at a later time to normalize blood parameters, following, for example, extensive courses of drug treatment. </p>
<p>Available colony stimulating factors can be used in different clinical stettings and the entire spectrum of clinical indications is only just now emerging. </p>

    <h2>G-CSF</h2>
    
<p>[Granulocyte colony stimulating factor] </p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>5637-derived factor; CSF-3 (colony stimulating factor-3); CSF-beta (colony stimulating factor-beta); DF (differentiation factor); D-Factor (leukemia cell differentiation inducing factor); G-CSA (granulocytic neutrophil colony stimulating activity); GM-DF (Granulocyte/macrophage and leukemia cell differentiation inducing factor); LBGF (leukemic blast growth factor); M1 differentiation inducing activity; MGI-1G (macrophage-granulocyte inducer-1G); MGI-2 (macrophage-granulocyte inducer-2) see: MGI-2A; NAP-IF (neutrophil alkaline phosphatase inducing factor); Pluripoietin; Pluripoietin-beta; pCSF (pluripotent colony stimulating factor); SCIF (suppressor cell inducing factor); </p>
<p>WEHI-3B differentiation inducing activity; </p>
<p>see also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>A recombinant mutated form of human G-CSF is KW-2228 (= Marograstim) (see also: Recombinant cytokines). Recombinant G-CSF is also marketed under the generic name Filgrastim and Lenograstim and under the brand names Neupogen, Neutrogin, and Granocyte. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>G-CSF was isolated initially as a factor supporting the growth of colonies of granulocytes in soft agar cultures (see also: CSF and Colony formation assay). </p>
<p>The factor is secreted by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils after cell activation. It is produced also by stromal cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Epithelial carcinomas, acute myeloid leukemia cells and various tumor cell lines (bladder carcinomas, medulloblastomas), also express this factor. </p>
<p>The synthesis of G-CSF can be induced by bacterial endotoxins, TNF, IL1 and GM-CSF. Prostaglandin E2 inhibits the synthesis of G-CSF. In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of G-CSF is induced by IL17. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>G-CSF is an O-glycosylated 19.6 kDa glycoprotein with a pI of 5.5. The biologically active form is a monomer. The analysis of its cDNA has revealed a protein of 207 amino acids containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 30 amino acids. G-CSF contains 5 cysteine residues, four of which form disulfide bonds (positions 36-42; 64-74). The sugar moiety of G-CSF is not required for full biological activity. </p>
<p>Comparison of the primary sequence of G-CSF with those of the two other colony stimulating factors, GM-CSF and M-CSF, shows that the three factors are not related to each other. Murine and human G-CSF show a sequence homology of approximately 70 % at the DNA level and of 72 % at the protein level. </p>
<p>For a series of artificial cytokines derived from sequences of human IL6 and GCSF (termed Harlequin molecules) see: Muteins. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene has a length of 2.5 kb and includes five exons. The human G-CSF gene maps to chromosome 17q21-q22. It is located in the vicinity of a translocation break point which frequently occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemias. </p>
<p>The nucleotide sequences of G-CSF and IL6 reveal similarities, which suggest that both genes are evolutionary related. </p>
<p>Differential splicing of the G-CSF mRNA can lead to the production of two variant forms of this protein. One of the resulting proteins is shortened by 3 amino acids. </p>
<p>The 5'region of the G-CSF gene contains several sequence domains called CLE (conserved lymphokine element). They are binding sites for transcription factors (see also: gene expression). One binding site, designated CK-1 (see: Cytokine 1) binds a transcription factor that mediates enhanced transcription of the G-CSF gene, inducible by several other cytokines. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The G-CSF receptor (new disgnation: CD114; see also: CD antigens) is expressed on all cells of the neutrophils and granulocytes lineage. It is expressed also in placenta cells, endothelial cells and various carcinoma cell lines. </p>
<p>The human receptor has a length of 813 amino acids. It displays the classical elements of many other cytokine receptors, i.e., an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The human receptor shows 62.5 % sequence homology to the murine receptor. The receptor binds G-CSF with high affinity (Kdis = 550 picoM). The gene encoding the human G-CSF receptor (CSF-3R) maps to chromosome 1p32-p34. 3. </p>
<p>At least four different forms of the human G-CSF receptor, resulting from alternative splicing of the mRNA, have been cloned from human placenta and U937 myeloid leukemia cells. One variant contains a deletion of the transmembrane region and is probably a soluble form of the receptor. Another variant contains 27 additional amino acids in its cytoplasmic domain. This form has been described to be expressed in placenta. </p>
<p>Severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) is characterized by profound absolute neutropenia and a maturation arrest of marrow progenitor cells at the stage of promyelocytes and myelocytes (see also: hematopoiesis). It has been shown that a somatic point mutation in one allele of the G-CSF receptor gene in a patient with severe congenital neutropenia results in a cytoplasmic truncation of the receptor. The mutant receptor chain still transduces a strong growth signal but this signal is unable to trigger maturation. The mutant receptor chain probably acts in a dominant negative manner to block granulocytic maturation. </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human G-CSF is active in murine cells and vice versa. G-CSF stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells committed to the neutrophils and granulocytes lineage in a dose-dependent manner (see also: hematopoiesis). At higher concentrations this factor induces the generation of colonies in soft agar cultures (see also: Colony formation assay) containing granulocytes and macrophages. The fully differentiated neutrophilic granulocytes are functionally activated by G-CSF (see also: cell activation). G-CSF is a mitogen for some human myeloid leukemia cells and also for some carcinoma cell lines. </p>
<p>G-CSF synergises with some other cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL4. GM-CSF and G-CSF are required, for example, to develop neutrophilic colonies in vitro. The concerted action of G-CSF and Epo is required to support the growth of mixed colonies of the early erythroid progenitors. A combination of IL4 with G-CSF has been shown to lead to synergistic suppression of the growth of some human leukemic cell lines. </p>
<p>In vitro G-CSF enhances the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of granulocytes against tumor cells. G-CSF induces the synthesis of receptors for fMLP (Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) which, in turn, induces the prolonged production of oxygen radicals and the release of arachidonic acid. G-CSF also increases the synthesis of Fc-receptors for IgA. Unlike GM-CSF, G-CSF does not induce the expression of cellular markers such as CD11A and CD11C. </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>G-CSF can be assayed in Colony formation assay employing murine bone marrow cells. Stimulation of proliferation of bone marrow cells induced by G-CSF is used also to assay this factor. G-CSF is also detected in specific bioassays with cells lines that depend in their growth on the presence of G-CSF or that respond to this factor (see: AML-193; 32D; BaF3; GNFS-60; HL-60, M1; NFS-60; OCI/AML1a; WEHI-3B). </p>
<p>An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The main and most important clinical application of G-CSF is probably the treatment of transient phases of leukopenia following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. G-CSF can be used to expand the myeloid cell lineage. It has been shown that the pretreatment with recombinant human G-CSF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) prior to marrow harvest can improve the graft by increasing the total number of myeloid lineage restricted progenitor cells, resulting in stable but not accelerated myeloid engraftment of autologous marrow. </p>
<p>Animal experiments and also the administration in humans have shown that the continuous administration of G-CSF for several days increases peripheral blood counts of neutrophils by a factor of 10-15-fold without having any effects on erythrocytes and platelets. The daily administration is required to maintain elevated levels of neutrophils. The duration of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and neutropenia following autologous bone marrow transplantation is also markedly decreased by treatment with G-CSF. </p>
<p>Marked improvements of hematological parameters have been observed also in the treatment of patients with congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome), patients with neutropenia caused by diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and in cases of chronic idiopathic neutropenia. One general effect of treatment with G-CSF appears to be a marked reduction of severe infections and episodes of fever which are normally observed to occur in these patients. G-CSF treatment also allows dose intensification with various antitumor drug regimes. The dosage of antibiotics can be reduced also. </p>
<p>It appears that the subcutaneous administration of G-CSF is more favorable at low doses than intravenous injection. Some animal experiments suggest that the effects of lethal irradiation can be abolished by a timely administration of G-CSF and that the complete reconstitution of hematopoiesis is possible. At present data from human irradiated patients are not yet available. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional G-CSF gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
