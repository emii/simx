<h1>IL13</h1>

    <h2>IL13</h2>
    
<p>Interleukin-13. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>IL13 is a protein originally detected by differential screening of a subtracted cDNA library prepared from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with antibodies directed against CD28. This cytokine, designated NC30, and murine P600, produced by Th2 T-helper cell clones following activation are probably homologous. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>Murine IL13 is produced primarily by activated Th2 cells. Human IL13 is expressed in activated T-helper cells (resembling Th0, Th1, Th2), and T-cells expressing CD8. It is not expressed in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>Murine IL13 has a length of 111 amino acids. The human and the murine proteins share 58 % sequence identity. Several isoform variants of human IL13 exist. They contain either Gly or Asp at position 61 and an insertion of Gln at position 98. Rat IL13 shows 63 % homology to murine and human IL13 at the amino acid level. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL13 cDNA is 66 % identical with that of the mouse. IL13 is a non-glycosylated protein of 132 amino acids that contains five cysteine residues. A variant containing an additional glutamine residue at position 98 has been described. It arises from alternative splicing at an intron-exon boundary and appears to have the same specific biological activity as IL13 lacking this additional amino acid. </p>
<p>The structure of the gene for IL13 is closely similar to that of IL3, IL5, IL4, and GM-CSF, and all five genes are clustered on 5q (see also: 5q minus syndrome). The IL13 gene is located between the GM-CSF and the IL4 gene, with the IL13 gene in close vicinity of the IL4 gene [centromer IL3 - GM-CSF - IL13 - IL4 - IL5 telomer]. The human IL13 gene is a single copy gene and contains four exons. It shows a high degree of sequence identity with the murine IL13 gene. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The human IL13 receptor-alpha chain has 76 % homology to the corresponding murine IL13 alpha chain (cloned as murine NR4). See: IL13RA1 [interleukin-13 receptor-alpha-1; IL13R-alpha-1]  </p>
<p>The alpha chain of the IL13 receptor has weak binding activity for IL13. High affinity receptors are formed when the receptor alpha chains of IL13 and IL4 receptors are coexpressed. The receptors for IL13 and IL4 share a common component, which is the common gamma subunit found also in the IL2 receptor. Antibodies against the IL4 receptor also block the activities of IL13. IL13 uses the one of the signaling molecules that is used also by IL4 (IL4-STAT; see: STAT proteins). The alpha chain of the IL13 receptor can serve as an alternative accessory protein to the common gamma chain for IL4 signaling. It cannot replace the function of the common gamma chain in allowing enhanced IL2 binding activity. </p>
<p>Different IL13 receptor structures have been shown to exist on various cell types and the IL13 receptor may share more than one component with IL4 receptor. IL13 competes for IL4 binding while IL4 does not compete for the IL13 binding on some cell types. </p>
<p>An IL4 variant, Y124D, in which Tyr124 is substituted by an aspartic acid residue has been shown to act as a powerful IL13 receptor antagonist. </p>
<p>For a soluble binding protein see: IL13BP. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>IL13 down-modulates macrophage activity, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12) and chemokines (MIP-1, MCP) in response to IFN-gamma or bacterial lypopolysaccharides. IL13 enhances the production of the IL1 receptor antagonist IL1ra. IL13 also decreases the production of nitric oxide by activated macrophages, leading to a decrease in parasiticidal activity. IL13 induces differentiation of human monocytes, enhances survival time in culture, and also induces differentiation and proliferation and Isotype switching in B-cells (see also: BGDF, B-cell growth and differentiation factors). It induces IL4 independent IgG4 and IgE synthesis in human B-cells and germ-line IgE heavy chain gene transcription. IL13 induces considerable levels of IgM and IgG, but no IgA, in cultures of highly purified surface IgD positive or total B-cells in the presence of an activated CD4(+) T-cell clone. IL13 induces proliferation and differentiation of human B-cells activated by the CD40 ligand (see: TRAP). IL13 synergizes with IL2 in regulating IFN-gamma synthesis in large granular lymphocytes. IL13 has been shown to inhibit strongly tissue factor expression induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides and to reduce the pyrogenic effects of IL1 or TNF, thus protecting endothelial cells and monocytes against inflammatory mediator induced procoagulant changes. IL13 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 production in primary blood-derived human macrophages in vitro. </p>
<p>Human basophils produce IL13 in response to IgE-receptor (IgER) crosslinking, IL3, IL3 plus C5a, but not C5a alone. </p>
<p>IL13, like IL4, induces CD23 expression on B-cells and enhances CD72, and class 2 major histocompatibility complex antigen expression. </p>
<p>IL13 has been observed to increase the killer activity of LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells) induced by IL2. Systemic immunity to parental tumor cells can be induced by IL13-secreting tumor cells in vivo. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL13 can be detected by bioassays involving the use of a subclone of the B9 hybridoma cell line (see: B9-1-3). Human and murine IL13 activities are assayed by employing human TF-1 erythroleukemia cells. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>A recombinant chimeric toxin composed of human IL13 and a Pseudomonas exotoxin A has been shown to be highly cytotoxic to cell lines derived from several human epithelial carcinomas such as adenocarcinoma of stomach, colon, and skin. A variety of human glioma cells that overexpress receptors for IL13 are extremely sensitive to very low doses of the IL13 fusion toxin (see also: Cytokine fusion toxins). </p>
<p>A chimeric cytotoxic protein composed of IL13 and a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL13 PE38QQR) has been found to be specifically and highly cytotoxic to cells derived from various AIDS associated angiogenic tumors of mixed cellularity known as Kaposi's sarcomas </p>
