<h1>CXCL1</h1>

    <h2>CXCL1</h2>
    
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL1 has been identified independently as CINC-2-beta, GRO1, GRO-alpha, KC, MGSA-alpha, MIP-2, NAP-3, N51, which are CXC-Chemokines. An older designation is SCYB1 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 1]. In databanks the gene encoding rat CINC-2-beta is listed as SCYB1 and SCYB3 (see also: SCY family of cytokines). </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL1. </p>
<p>Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL1 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. </p>
<p>CXCL1 has been shown to be cleaved by the metalloproteinase MMP-12 at the ELR sequence motif, which is known to be the critical receptor binding motif (Dean et al, 2008). </p>

    <h2>MGSA</h2>
    
<p>[melanoma growth stimulatory activity] Human MGSA (73 amino acids) is encoded by a gene mapping to chromosome 4q21. This gene is called GRO (growth regulated oncogene; see also: Oncogene) and contains four exons. The GRO gene was identified initially by its constitutive overexpression in spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster fibroblasts. </p>
<p>Three different GRO genes have been described. At the nucleotide level they show a homology of approximately 90 %. GRO-alpha encodes MGSA (also termed MGSA-alpha). Several variants are known (see also: FINAP, fibroblast-derived neutrophil-activating peptide). The human cytokine NAP-3 (neutrophil-activating protein-3) is identical with MGSA-alpha. Wuyts et al (1999) have reported that cultured tumor cells produce predominantly the full-length factor, whereas peripheral blood monocytes secreted mainly aminoterminally truncated forms. Truncated GRO-alpha [4,5,6-73] is 30-fold more active than the corresponding intact chemokine. </p>
<p>The protein encoded by GRO-beta (also termed MGSA-beta) is identical with MIP-2-alpha (see: MIP). The new designation is CXCL2 and the gene symbol is SCYB2. </p>
<p>A truncated form of GRO-beta with dramatically increased biological activities has been described under the name HSF (hematopoietic synergistic factor). Another truncated form is SB-251353. </p>
<p>GRO-gamma (also termed MGSA-gamma) is identical with MIP-2-beta (see: MIP). 53 % sequence identity is observed between GRO-alpha and a cytokine called ENA-78. The new designation for GRO-gamma is CXCL3 and the gene symbol is SCYB3. Wuyts et al (1999) have reported that cultured tumor cells produce predominantly the full-lengt factor, whereas peripheral blood monocytes secreted mainly aminoterminally truncated forms. Truncated GRO-gamma[5-73] is fivefold more active than the corresponding intact chemokine. </p>
<p>MGSA belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (CXC-Chemokines). The new designation for GRO-alpha or MGSA-alpha is CXCL1 and the gene symbol is SCYB1. A characteristic feature of the three gro factors is the presence of a conserved ELR sequence motif. Some members of the Chemokine family are encoded by genes lying in the vicinity of the GRO gene at 4q21. </p>
<p>A related protein is encoded by the murine mig gene. Its synthesis in macrophages is specifically induced by IFN-gamma. mig in turn is related to a protein called KC the synthesis of which in murine cells is induced by PDGF. Murine KC and the human GRO genes are homologous. A rat homolog of MGSA is CINC. The avian homolog of the GRO gene is 9E3. </p>
<p>The three GRO genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. GRO proteins are found predominantly in monocytes after cell activation but are expressed also in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, synovial cells, and several tumor cell lines. The expression of the GRO genes is specifically induced by IL1 in cells the proliferation of which is stimulated also by IL1. Other inducers of GRO expression are TNF and IL6. All three factors are capable of inducing the synthesis of GRO proteins approximately 100-fold under suitable conditions. </p>
<p>MGSA has inflammatory and growth-regulating properties. MGSA is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils (see also: Chemotaxis) and enhances their degranulation and the release of lysosomal enzymes. Increased concentrations of MGSA have been observed in psoriatic scales, which are also characterized by an increased infiltration of neutrophils. MGSA promotes the growth of fibroblasts. </p>
<p>MGSA is an autostimulatory growth factor for melanoma cells (see: also: autocrine for autostrimulatory growth control mechanisms). The hexapeptide antileukinate, which is a potent inhibitor of binding of alpha-Chemokines to their receptors on neutrophils, has been shown to inhibits the growth of various melanoma cell lines by preventing MGSA from binding to its receptor. MGSA produced by subsets of spinal cord astrocytes has been shown to be a strong mitogen for precursor cells of oligodendrocytes and to enhance the effect of PDGF on these cells. MGSA also is a growth factor for human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the effect can be inhibited by antileukinate (Fujisawa et al, 1999). </p>
<p>MGSA and GRO proteins are functionally related to IL8 and also bind to the same receptor albeit with different affinities. For another function of the MGSA/GRO/IL8/MIP receptor see also: CKR1. For a viral NAP-2 receptor homolog see also: ECRF-3. GRO-alpha has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
