    <h2>IL10</h2>
    
<p>Interleukin-10. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>B-TCGF (B-cell derived T-cell growth factor); CSIF (cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor); TGIF (T-cell growth inhibitory factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL10 is produced by murine T-cells (Th2 cells but not Th1 T-helper cells) following their stimulation by lectins. The main source for B-cell derived IL10 in mice are Ly1 (B-1) B-cells that express CD5 (Ly1) and CD11 (Mac-1). Murine keratinocytes also produce IL10. </p>
<p>In humans IL10 is produced by activated CD8(+) peripheral blood T-cells, by T-helper CD4(+) T-cell clones (resembling Th0, Th1, and Th2) after both antigen-specific and polyclonal activation, by B-cell lymphomas, and by monocytes following cell activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharides and mast cells. B-cell lines derived from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Burkitt's lymphoma constitutively secrete large quantities of IL10 into the conditioned medium. The synthesis of IL10 by monocytes is inhibited by IL4 and IL10. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL10 is a homodimeric protein with subunits having a length of 160 amino acids. Human IL10 shows 73 % amino acid homology with murine IL10. For viral proteins homologous with IL10 see also: BCRF-1, orf virus, HVP IL10, EHV-2 IL10, CMV IL10, SCMV IL10, YLDV IL10. For structurally related proteins see also: IL10 family. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL10 contains four exons. It is related closely to the product of the BCRF-1 gene (Bam HI C fragment rightward reading frame) of Epstein-Barr virus (84 % homology at the protein level); These two proteins are related more closely to each other than human and murine IL10. BCRF-1 has therefore also been called viral IL10 (vIL10). Other viruses contain other viral forms of IL10 (see: viral IL10). The human IL10 gene maps to chromosome 1. The human IL10 shows 81 % homology with murine IL10 at the nucleotide level. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>IL10RA [IL10R-alpha] is the approved gene symbol for IL10 receptor-alpha (also: IL10R1), which is the ligand binding subunit of the dimeric receptor. The cDNA for IL10RA has been identified by Liu et al. (1994) who referred to it as IL10R. The human protein shares 60 % amino acid identity and 73 % similarity with its mouse homolog. mouse IL10 is capable of blocking binding of human IL10 to mouse but not human cells (Tan et al, 1993). In the nomenclature of CD antigens this receptor subunit has been given the designation CDw210a, which has been replaced by CD210a. IL10RB: </p>
<p>[IL10 receptor-beta; IL10R-beta] This is the approved gene symbol for the signaling subunit of the dimeric IL10 receptor. This receptor subunit is being referred to also as IL10R2. The subunit has been identified independently as CRF2-4 [cytokine receptor family 2 member 4] and the gene has been termed CRFB4. IL10RB is part also of the receptor complex for IL26. </p>
<p>In the nomenclature of CD antigens this receptor subunit is sometimes being referred to as CDw210b. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>IL10 inhibits the synthesis of a number of cytokines such as IFN-gamma, IL2 and TNF-beta in Th1 T-helper subpopulations of T-cells but not of Th2 T-helper cells. This activity is antagonized by IL4. The inhibitory effect on IFN-gamma production is indirect and appears to be the result of a suppression of IL12 synthesis by accessory cells. In the human system, IL10 is produced by, and downregulates the function of, Th1 cells and Th2 cells. In macrophages stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (see also: cell activation) IL10 inhibits the synthesis of IL1, IL6 and TNF-alpha by promoting, among other things, the degradation of cytokine mRNA. It also leads to an inhibition of antigen presentation. In human monocytes IFN-gamma and IL10 antagonize each other's production and function. IL10 has been shown also to be a physiologic antagonist of IL12. </p>
<p>IL10 also inhibits mitogen- or anti-CD3 induced proliferation of T-cells in the presence of accessory cells and reduces the production of IFN-gamma and IL2. Exogenous IL2 and IL4 inhibit the proliferation-inhibitory effect but do not influence the production of IFN-gamma. In macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides IFN-gamma increases the synthesis of IL6 by inhibiting the production of IL10. IL10 (CSIF) appears to be responsible for most or all of the ability of the conditioned medium of Th2 T-helper cells to inhibit cytokine synthesis by Th1 cells. </p>
<p>IL10 inhibits in vivo the secretion of TNF-alpha and protects against the lethality of endotoxin in a murine model of septic shock if administered before challenging the mice with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p>IL10 inhibits secretion of Ig by T-cell independent antigens induced by IL5 but not that induced by IL2. </p>
<p>Murine Ly1 cells are the principal source of IL10, cells. In contrast to normal B-cells, Ly1 B-cells express greatly elevated constitutive and inducible levels of IL10. These cells also have the distinctive property of continuous self-replenishment. The continuous treatment of newborn mice with anti-IL10 antibodies leads to a depletion of the Ly1 B-cells while maintaining a normal population of splenic B-cells. These mice also contain greatly reduced serum immunoglobulin M levels and are also impaired in their antibody responses to specific antigens. IL10 is therefore a regulator of the development of Ly1 B-cells. The mechanism of Ly1 B-cell depletion appears to involve the increased production of IFN-gamma since coadministration of neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibodies substantially restores the number of peritoneal-resident Ly1 B-cells in these mice. </p>
<p>IL10 acts as a costimulator of the proliferation of mast cells (in the presence of IL3 and/or IL4) and peripheral lymphocytes. While IL10 alone has not effects on the proliferation of mast cells and their progenitors a combination of IL10 and IL4 has the same growth-promoting effects as IL3 alone. Optimal growth of mast cells is achieved by a combination of IL3, IL4 and IL10. Due to its effects on mast cells IL10 probably plays a role in the development of mastocytosis frequently observed after parasitic infections by potentiating the effects of IL3 and IL4. </p>
<p>IL10 is also a costimulator for the growth of mature and immature thymocytes (together with IL2, IL4 and IL7) and functions as a cytotoxic T-cell differentiation factor, promoting a higher number of IL2 activated precursors of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells. IL10 sustains viability of B-cells in vitro and also stimulates B-cells and promotes their differentiation (see also: BCDF, B-cell differentiation factor). It enhances the expression of MHC class 2 antigens on B-cells whereas it inhibits MHC class 2 expression on monocytes. In B-cells activated via their antigen receptors or via CD40 IL10 induces the secretion of IgG, IgA and IgM. This effect is synergised by IL4 while the synthesis of immunoglobulins induced by IL10 is antagonized by TGF-beta. The activation of macrophages can be prevented by IL10. </p>
<p>It has been shown that human IL10 is a potent and specific chemoattractant for human T-lymphocytes. The chemotactic activity (see also: Chemotaxis) is directed towards cells expressing CD8 and not towards CD4(+) cells. IL10 also inhibits the chemotactic response of CD4(+) cells, but not of CD8(+) cells, towards IL8. </p>
<p>Viral BCRF-1 protein does not support the proliferation of mast cells although it blocks the synthesis of cytokines like IL10. The viral protein is expressed during the productive phase of EBV proliferation in B-lymphocytes. It has been assumed that this protein suppresses antiviral immune responses by specifically inhibiting the synthesis of IFN-gamma and other cytokines that would kill the host cell expressing viral antigens at the cell surface. By employing this strategy EBV therefore has a powerful mechanism providing some selective growth advantages over other viruses (see also: Viroceptor). BCRF-1 also enhances the reactivation of virus-specific cytotoxic responses of T-cells and HLA-unrestricted killer cells. Since BCRF-1 is expressed during the lytic cycle of EBV, its may enhance immune responses to EBV-infected cells also during periods of virus replication in vivo, thus effectively limiting its own replication to maintain the apathogenic virus carrier state that is characteristic of EBV. BCRF-1 has been shown also to inhibit superoxide anion production by human monocytes. For another virus-encoded protein increasing survival of virus-infected cells see: BHRF-1. </p>
<p>IL10 has been found also to be produced by a number of AIDS lymphomas and it has been suggested that this factor may stimulate the proliferation of malignant cells in an autocrine manner with EBV and HIV synergistically triggering its production. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Transgenic expression of IL10 in the islets of Langerhans of transgenic mice has been shown to lead to a pronounced inflammation of the pancreas, without inflammation of the islets of Langerhans and without diabetes. This recruitment of inflammatory cells to the pancreas is in marked contrast to the biological activities of IL10 in vitro which indicate that IL10 is a powerful immunosuppressive cytokine. IL10, therefore, provides a potent recruitment signal for migration of leukocytes in vivo and these effects are relevant for in vivo therapeutic applications of IL10. </p>
<p>Transgenic knock-out mice in which the IL10 gene has been inactivated by targeted mutation in ES cells have been generated to study the biological activities of IL10. These mice show normal development of lymphocytes and antibody responses. However, most animals are growth retarded and anemic and suffer from chronic enterocolitis. Extensive mucosal hyperplasia, inflammatory reactions, and aberrant expression of major histocompatibility complex class 2 molecules on epithelia are noted in the intestines. The observation that these animals only develop a local inflammation limited to the proximal colon if kept under specific pathogen-free conditions suggests that IL10 is an essential immunoregulator in the intestinal tract and that the generalized bowel inflammation in IL10 deficient animals is due to uncontrolled immune responses stimulated by enteric antigens. </p>
<p>Gazzinelli et al (1996) have inoculated IL10 knock-out mice with an avirulent parasite strain. IL10 deficient animals succumb to a lethal immune response without any evidence of enhanced parasite proliferation. Levels of IL12 and IFN-gamma in sera of these animals are four- to sixfold higher than those in sera from control mice. Activated macrophages from these mice produce higher levels of TNF-alpha and IL12 than macrophages from control animals and spleen cells secrete more IFN-gamma than normal splenocytes. If lymphocytes expressing CD4, which are the major source of the cytokines are depleted in vivo depletion with anti-CD4 antibodies the animals are protected from parasite induced mortality. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL10 can be detected with a sensitive ELISA assay. The murine cell line D36 (mast cells) can be used to bioassay human IL10. The intracellular factor can be detected also by flow cytometry. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The introduction of an IL10 expression vector into CHO cells has been used to analyze the consequences of local IL10 production in vivo. These altered cells were no longer tumorigenic in nude mice or severe combined immunodeficient SCID mice (see also: Immunodeficient mice) and also suppressed the growth of equal numbers of co-injected normal CHO cells. While normal CHO tumors are usually substantially infiltrated by macrophages were virtually absent within CHO-IL10 tumor tissues, suggesting that IL10 indirectly suppresses tumor growth of certain tumors by inhibiting infiltration of macrophages, which may provide tumor growth-promoting activity. </p>
<p>IL10 has been detected in the sera of a subgroup of patients with active non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. IL10 levels appear to correlate with a poor survival in patients with intermediate or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. </p>
