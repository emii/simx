    <h2>TNF-beta</h2>
    
<p>tumor necrosis factor-beta. Abbr. also TNFB. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>Coley's toxin; CTX (cytotoxin); DIF (differentiation inducing factor); F-1 (factor-1); Hemorrhagic factor; LT (lymphotoxin = LT-alpha; see also: LT-beta); Necrosin; NKCF (natural killer cytotoxic factor); NK-CIA (Natural killer colony-inhibiting activity). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>The new nomenclature is TNFSF1 [TNF ligand superfamily member 1], based on homology with other members of the TNF ligand superfamily of proteins. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>This factor is produced predominantly by mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocytes and leukocytes. The factor is secreted also by fibroblasts, astrocytes, myeloma cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells and a number of transformed cell lines. The synthesis of TNF-beta is stimulated by interferons (see: IFN) and IL2. Some pre-B-cell lines and Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B-cell lines constitutively produce TNF-beta. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>TNF-beta is a protein of 171 amino acids N-glycosylated at position 62. Some cell lines secrete different glycosylated forms of the factor that may differ also in their biological activities. The protein does not contain disulfide bonds and forms heteromers with LT-beta that anchors the complexes in the membrane. TNF-beta and TNF-alpha show approximately 30 % sequence homology. Murine and human TNF-beta are highly homologous (74 %). Recombinant human proteins (see also: Recombinant cytokines, Muteins) with deletions of 27 amino acids from the N-terminus appear to be biologically active in several bioassays. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene has a length of approximately 3 kb and contains four exons. It encodes a primary transcript of 2038 nucleotides yielding a mRNA of 1.4 kb. The gene maps to human chromosome 6p23-6q12 approximately 1.2 kb apart from the TNF-alpha gene. However, both genes are regulated independently. The 5' region of the TNF-beta promoter contains a poly(dA-dT)-rich sequence that binds the nonhistone protein HMG-1 which is involved in the regulation of the constitutive expression of the gene. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>TNF-beta binds to the same receptor as TNF-alpha. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>TNF-beta acts on a plethora of different cells. This activity is not species-specific. Human TNF-beta acts on murine cells but shows a slightly reduced specific activity. In general, TNF-beta and TNF-alpha display similar spectra of biological activities in in vitro systems, although TNF-beta is often less potent or displays apparent partial agonist activity. </p>
<p>TNF-beta induces the synthesis of GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL1, collagenase, and prostaglandin E2 in fibroblasts. </p>
<p>TNF-beta is cytolytic or cytostatic for many tumor cells. In monocytes TNF-beta induces the terminal differentiation and the synthesis of G-CSF. TNF-beta is a mitogen for B-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>In neutrophils TNF-beta induces the production of reactive oxygen species. It is also a chemoattractant for these cells (see also: Chemotaxis), increases phagocytosis, and also increases adhesion to the endothelium. </p>
<p>TNF-beta inhibits the growth of osteoclasts and keratinocytes. Although TNF-beta binds to the same receptor as TNF-alpha it is not involved in the establishment of an endotoxin shock (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome). </p>
<p>TNF-beta promotes the proliferation of fibroblasts and is involved probably in processes of wound healing in vivo. Hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors induced by TNF-beta in vivo is probably the result of an inhibition of the growth of endothelial cells and the activity of TNF-beta as an anti-angiogenesis factor (see: Angiogenesis). </p>
<p>Administration of TNF induces metabolic acidosis, decreases the partial pressure of CO2, induces the synthesis of stress hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucagon, and also alters glucose metabolism. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of TNF-beta have been studied in transgenic (mice) expressing the murine TNF-beta gene under the control of the rat insulin II promoter in the pancreas, kidney, and skin. The expression of TNF-beta in the pancreas of transgenic mice results in a leukocytic inflammatory infiltrate consisting primarily of B220(+) IgM(+) B-cells and CD4(+) CD8(+) T-cells. The insulitis is reminiscent of the early stages of diabetes, though the mice do not progress to diabetes. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of a TNF-beta gene disruption have been studied in mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the TNF-beta gene have no morphologically detectable lymph nodes or Peyer's patches. The development of the thymus appears normal. Within the white pulp of the spleen there is a failure of normal segregation of B-cells and T-cells. Spleen and peripheral blood contain CD4(+) CD8(-) T-cells and CD4(-) CD8(+) cells in a normal ration, and both T-cell subsets have an apparently normal lytic function. Lymphocytes positive for IgM are present in increased numbers in both the spleen and peripheral blood. These data suggest an essential role of TNF-beta in the normal development of peripheral lymphoid organs. However, the mechanism by which TNF-beta contributes to normal lymphoid development remains unknown. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>TNF-beta can be detected in bioassays involving cell lines that respond to it (see: BT-20, KYM-1D4, L929; L-M; WEHI-3B). TNF-beta can be detected also by an ELISA test and an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Higuchi et al (1995) have described an assay based on the release of tritiated thymidine from cells undergoing apoptosis after treatment with either TNF-alpha or TNF-beta. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, IL4, LIF and GM-CSF have been shown not to interfere with this assay. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The clinical application of this factor is only in its initial stages. The intrapleural administration of TNF-beta may significantly reduce liquid volumes in some metastasizing ascites tumors. TNF-beta levels in the sera of patients with meningococcal septicemia have been shown to correlate with morbidity and mortality. </p>
