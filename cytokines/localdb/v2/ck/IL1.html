<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>Monocytes are the main source of secreted IL1. They express predominantly IL1-beta while human keratinocytes express large amounts of IL1-alpha. Murine macrophages display a transition from IL1-beta to IL1-alpha production during maturation of monocytes into inflammatory macrophages (see also: inflammation). </p>
<p>IL1 is produced also by activated macrophages from different sources (alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, adherent spleen and peritoneal macrophages) and also by peripheral neutrophil granulocytes. Endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, Langerhans cells of the skin, osteoclasts, astrocytes, epithelial cells of the thymus and the cornea, T-cells, B-cells, NK-cells and many melanoma cell lines also produce IL1. The constitutive production of IL1 by human umbilical vein endothelial cells is inhibited by Transthyretin (Borish et al, 1992). </p>
<p>The release of IL1 from isolated rat macrophages in culture is stimulated by Histogranin. </p>
<p>The concentrations of IL1 observed in the cerebrospinal fluid are due to local synthesis and also due to the direct transport of IL1 through the blood-brain barrier by means of a saturable carrier system and the ability of activated T-lymphocytes to pass this barrier. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>There are two functionally almost equivalent forms of IL1, IL1-alpha (17 kDa, 159 amino acids; pI = 5.0) and IL1-beta (17 kDa, 153 amino acids; pI = 7.0) that are encoded by two different genes. IL1-beta is the predominant form in humans while it is IL1-alpha in mice. </p>
<p>At the protein level IL1-alpha and IL1-beta display approximately 27 % homology mainly restricted to the carboxyterminal region; the names therefore suggest a relationship that does not really exist. On the other hand the three-dimensional of the two IL1 forms are almost identical. Both forms are spherical proteins devoid of alpha-helical regions, and both forms also bind to the same receptor. </p>
<p>Rabbit, mouse, and human IL1-alpha show approximately 61-65 % sequence homology at the protein level. Only 27-33 % sequence homology is observed with IL1-beta isolated from these three species. Rat IL1 and human-IL1-alpha show 65 % homology. </p>
<p>IL1-alpha and IL1-beta are synthesized as precursors of approximately 35 kDa (271 amino acid precursor for IL1-alpha and 269 amino acids for IL1-beta). The mature proteins are generated by proteolytic cleavage by a number of proteases. Cells of the myelomonocytic lineage also express a IL1-beta-specific protease (see: IL1-Convertase; Caspases) that can be inhibited by protease inhibitors such as Pentamidine. </p>
<p>Low molecular weight forms of IL1 (11, 4, 2 kDa) have been found also in serum and are secreted in the urine. The IL1-alpha precursor is biologically active but not the IL1-beta precursor. </p>
<p>IL1 is unusual in that the intracellular precursors do not contain a recognizable hydrophobic secretory signal sequence that would allow secretion of the protein by classical secretory pathways involving the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi system. Mature forms of IL1-alpha and IL1-beta and also their precursors are found to be secreted by murine macrophages after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. At least IL1-beta has been shown to be cleaved by an LPS-inducible protease after externalization (see also: endotoxins). IL1-beta precursors can be cleaved by proteases including elastase, cathepsin G, and collagenase, which are the major proteases released at sites of inflammation. </p>
<p>Apart from secreted forms of IL1, a biologically active 22 kDa form associated with the cell surface membrane has been described also. It consists mainly of IL1-alpha and may be involved in juxtacrine growth control involving the interaction with receptors in adjacent cells. A nuclear targeting sequence (see: signal sequence) has been identified in the IL1-alpha precursor, suggesting that this factor may act also in the cell nucleus (see also: intracrine). </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>IL1-alpha and IL1-beta are encoded by two different genes of different lengths (IL1-alpha = 12 kb; IL1-beta = 9.7 kb) and similar organization comprising seven exons. The IL1-alpha mRNA has a length of 2-2.3 kb that for IL1-beta a length of 1.6-1.7 kb. At the DNA level both genes show a homology of approximately 45 %. The sequences of rat and human IL1-alpha show approximately 73 % sequence homology. </p>
<p>The IL1-beta promoter is approximately 10-50-fold stronger than that of the IL1-alpha gene. The human IL1 genes map to chromosome 2 (IL1-alpha = 2q13; IL1-beta = 2q13-q21) in the vicinity of the gene encoding the IL1 receptor antagonist IL1ra. In the mouse the two genes map to chromosome 2 and are approximately 50 kb apart. They have the same orientation and the IL1-beta gene is 5' to the IL1-alpha gene. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>Both forms of IL1 bind to the same receptor and therefore also show similar if not identical biological activities. The IL1-beta but not the IL1-alpha precursor must be processed before it can bind to the receptor. </p>
<p>Two kinds of IL1 receptors that bind with different affinities (10**-9 - 10**-10 and 10**-11 M) have been described. IL1-alpha and IL1-beta block the binding of each other to the receptor. </p>
<p>The receptor isolated from T-cells (80 kDa; p80) is expressed predominantly on T-cells and cells of mesenchymal origin. It binds both types of IL1 with equal affinity. This type is called also Type 1 receptor. It has been designated CD121a. It is encoded by a gene mapping to human chromosome 2q12. The receptor contains three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and therefore is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. The entire protein has a length of 576 amino acids consisting of an extracellular ligand-binding domain and a cytoplasmic domain of 213 amino acids. This receptor contains seven N-glycosylation sites. The extracellular domain and also the transmembrane region of 21 amino acids do not show any relationship to other proteins. </p>
<p>The Type 2 receptor of 60 kDa (p60) consists of 398 amino acids with a short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino acids. It has been designated CD121b. It is isolated from B-cells, granulocytes, and macrophages. It is expressed predominantly on B-cells and cells of the myelomonocytic lineage and is encoded by a separate gene. Specific IL1 receptors have been found in the central nervous system that bind IL1-beta much stronger than IL1-alpha. Both types of IL1 receptors also bind the IL1 receptor antagonist IL1ra. </p>
<p>Biological activities of IL1 have been observed also at concentration ranges of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M which may suggest the existence of high affinity receptor conformations or the existence of other high affinity receptors. The binding of IL1 to the type 1 receptor can be blocked by Suramin. </p>
<p>IL1 receptors are expressed at various densities from several thousand up to approximately 10000/cell in many different cell types. Many cell types also constitutively express IL1 receptors at low densities. Receptor densities generally increases following the stimulation of cells by IL1. The incubation with glucocorticoids increases IL1 receptor densities approximately 10-fold. </p>
<p>IL1 receptor mediated signal transduction involves adenylate cyclase which transiently increases intracellular cAMP levels. A cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP binding protein of 46 kDa are also involved. Binding of IL1 to its receptor activates transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see also: gene expression). Protein kinase C (PKC), calcium (see also: Calcium ionophore), phosphatidyl inositol and related metabolites do not appear to be involved in signal transduction. </p>
<p>Vaccinia and cowpox virus encode an IL1-beta specific binding protein that is capable of modulating the biological activities of IL1 (see: B15R). </p>
<p>For receptor-like and receptor-related molecules see also: T1/ST2, IL1Rrp (IL1 receptor-related protein), IL1RAcP (IL1 receptor accessory protein). For type 1 receptor associated proteins see also: IRAK (IL1 receptor-associated kinase). </p>
<p>A factor resembling STAT proteins, termed LIL factor, has been found to be involved in signaling pathways of IL1, and also of IL6 and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>IL1-alpha and IL1-beta are biologically more or less equivalent pleiotropic factors that act locally and also systemically. Only a few functional differences between the factors have been described; only IL1-beta appears to be expressed constitutively in the brain. </p>
<p>The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL1 has been described. IL1 does not show species specificity with the exception of human IL1-beta that is inactive in porcine cells. Some of the biological activities of IL1 are mediated indirectly by the induction of the synthesis of other mediators including ACTH (Corticotropin; see: POMC, proopiomelanocortin), PGE2, PF4 (platelet factor-4), CSF (colony stimulating factors), IL6, and IL8. </p>
<p>The synthesis of IL1 can be induced by other cytokines including TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-gamma and also by bacterial endotoxins, viruses, mitogens, and antigens. In human skin fibroblasts IL1-alpha and TNF-alpha induce the synthesis of IL1-beta. In pheochromocytoma cells (see also: PC12) NGF induces the synthesis of IL1. Human mononuclear cells are very sensitive to bacterial endotoxins and synthesize IL1 in response to picogramm/mL amounts of endotoxins. In human monocytes bacterial lipopolysaccharides induce approximately tenfold more mRNA and the respective proteins for IL1-beta than for IL1-alpha. </p>
<p>The synthesis of IL1 is controlled by a complex feedback loop since IL1 is capable also of inhibiting or promoting its own synthesis, depending on conditions and cell types. </p>
<p>In vitro PGE2, the synthesis of which is increased by IL1, and glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of IL1. The PGE2 mediated inhibition of IL1 synthesis, like the inhibition of IL1 synthesis caused by IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, is mediated by an increase of intracellular cAMP levels. IL6 can also inhibit the synthesis of IL1. The synthesis of IL1 is also controlled by natural inhibitors (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), themselves induced by IL1, and is inhibited also by lipoproteins, lipids, and Alpha-2-Macroglobulin. IL1 induces the expression of the fos oncogene and the myc oncogene. </p>
<p>The main biological activity of IL1 is the stimulation of T-helper cells, which are induced to secrete IL2 and to express IL2 receptors. Virus-infected macrophages produce large amounts of an IL1 inhibitor that may support opportunistic infections and transformation of cells in patients with T-cell maturation defects (see: IL1ra). </p>
<p>IL1 acts directly on B-cells, promoting their proliferation and the synthesis of immunoglobulins. IL1 also functions as one of the priming factors that makes B-cells responsive to IL5. IL1 stimulates the proliferation and activation of NK-cells and fibroblasts, thymocytes, glioblastoma cells. It also promotes the proliferation of astroglial cells and microglial cells and may be involved in pathological processes such as astrogliosis and demyelinisation. The IL1 mediated proliferation of lymphocytes is inhibited by TGF-beta-1 and TGF-beta-2 (see: TGF-beta). </p>
<p>A mechanism of autocrine growth control by IL1 has been suggested for leukemic blast cells in which the uncontrolled synthesis of IL1 is thought to lead to the production of colony stimulating factors (see also: CSF) that in turn promote the proliferation of these cells. In combination with other cytokines. IL1 appears to be an autocrine growth modulator for human gastric and thyroid carcinoma cells. The growth-promoting activities of IL1 are mediated indirectly in some systems by regulating the expression of high affinity receptors for another cytokine, FGF. </p>
<p>IL1 has been shown also to be radioprotective. </p>
<p>IL1 also has antiproliferative and cytocidal activities on certain tumor cell types. It supports tumor cytotoxicity mediated by monocytes and induces tumor regression. IL1 is cytotoxic for insulin-producing beta-cells of the Langerhans islets of the pancreas. </p>
<p>IL1 inhibits the growth of endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. It also inhibits the growth of rat hepatocytes in culture. </p>
<p>IL1 causes many alterations of endothelial functions in vivo. It promotes thrombotic processes and attenuates anticoagulatory mechanisms. IL1 therefore plays an important role in pathological processes such as venous thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, vasculitis, and disseminated intravasal coagulation. </p>
<p>IL1 promotes the adhesion of neutrophils, monocytes, T-cells, and B-cells by enhancing the expression of adhesion molecules such as CAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule) and ELAM (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule). The expression of membrane-associated thrombomodulin is decreased by IL1. </p>
<p>IL1 also influences the functional activities of Langerhans cells of the skin. These cells are not capable of eliciting primary immune responses (for example, contact sensibilisation). IL1 (and also GM-CSF) convert these cells into potent immunostimulatory dendritic cells. The Langerhans cells therefore constitute an in situ reservoir for immunologically immature lymphoid dendritic cells. The increased ability of maturated Langerhans cell to process antigens is decreased by TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>IL1 in combination with other cytokines is an important mediator of inflammatory reactions. IL1 markedly enhances the metabolism of arachidonic acid (in particular of prostacyclin and PGE2) in inflammatory cells such as fibroblasts, synovial cells, chondrocytes, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and osteoclasts. In addition one observes an increased secretion of inflammatory proteins such as neutral proteases (collagenase, elastase and plasminogen activator). This activity of IL1 antagonizes the effects of TGF-beta on the extracellular matrix. </p>
<p>IL1 is also a strong chemoattractant for leukocytes (see also: Chemotaxis); in vivo the injection of IL1 leads to the local accumulation of neutrophils at the site of injection. IL1 also activates oxidative metabolism in neutrophils. </p>
<p>In combination with TNF IL1 appears to be involved in the generation of lytic bone lesions. IL1 activates osteoclasts and therefore suppresses the formation of new bone. Low concentrations of IL1, however, promote new bone growth. IL1 inhibits the enzyme lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes. In vascular smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts IL1 induces the synthesis of bFGF which is a mitogen for these cells. </p>
<p>Like IL2 IL1 also modulates the electrophysiological behavior of neurons. IL1 also directly affects the central nervous system as an afferent signal modulating the release of a number of hormones and activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (see: Neuroimmune network). In the hypothalamus IL1 activates the serotoninergic system. IL1 also functions as an endogenous pyrogen (see: EP) and induces a significant elevation of body temperature by causing the release of prostaglandins in the thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus. This activity is inhibited by Alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (Alpha-MSH; see: POMC, proopiomelanocortin). IL1, like IL6, stimulates the synthesis of ACTH (Corticotropin) in the pituitary and also induces the release of Luteinizing hormone, Growth hormone, Thyrotropin, and CRF (corticotropin releasing factor; see: POMC). IL1 also enhances expression of the POMC gene (Pro-opiomelanocortin) which yields ACTH, Beta-Endorphin, Alpha-MSH, Beta-MSH, and c-MSH. Glucocorticoids synthesized in response to ACTH inhibit the production of IL6, IL1 and TNF in vivo, thus establishing a sort of negative feedback loop between the immune system and neuroendocrine functions. Alpha-MSH inhibits the IL1 activities by an as yet unknown mechanism. IL1 induces the synthesis of corticostatin by granulocytes, which in turn inhibits the ACTH-induces synthesis of glucocorticosteroids. Glucocorticosteroids on the other hand increase the expression of IL1 receptors. In blood serum IL1 has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of iron and zinc. In Schwann cells and fibroblast-like cells of nervous tissue IL1 induces the synthesis of NGF. </p>
<p>IL1-beta immunoreactive nerve fibers in human hypothalamus innervate those endocrine and autonomous nuclei controlling central aspects of acute phase reaction. Astrocytes proliferate in the presence of IL1 and release IL3 which is a growth factor for microglial cells and peritoneal macrophages. In Astrocytes IL1 also promotes the synthesis of GM-CSF, IL6 and TNF. In the central nervous system IL1 is involved also in the induction of the so-called slow-wave sleep. IL1-beta can prevent the depression of antibody responses observed during sleep deprivation. The important role of IL1 for the connections between the brain and the immune system is also exemplified by the observation that IL1 after intraperitoneal injection into Wistar rats stimulates the metabolism of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin in the hypothalamus and the dorsal posterior brain stem. Some neuropeptides such as neurotensin, SP (substance P), and neurokinin A and neurokinin B (see: Tachykinins) are themselves capable of enhancing the synthesis of IL1. In certain neurons of the rat hypothalamus IL1-beta induces the synthesis of Somatostatin. </p>
<p>IL1 synergises with some other factors. The effect of IL1 on the proliferation of thymocytes involves the stimulation of IL2 synthesis and the expression of IL2 receptors on T-cells. For certain T-helper cell populations and also for B-cells IL1 functions as an additional growth factor. IL1 potentiates the effects of colony stimulating factors (see also: CSF) and promotes the generation of myeloid progenitor cells from stem cells (see also: hematopoiesis). IL1 synergises with GM-CSF in the induction of macrophage colony growth. IL1 can also induce the synthesis of G-CSF and M-CSF by bone marrow stromal cells (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture) and stimulates the synthesis of GM-CSF and G-CSF by human skin cells and of GM-CSF by peripheral blood lymphocytes. By enhancing the expression of receptors for colony stimulating factors IL1 is involved in various processes of hematopoiesis. IL1 also induces the proliferation of pluripotent bone marrow progenitor cells. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Groves et al (1995, 1996) have generated transgenic mice overexpressing functional type 1 IL1 receptor in the basal layer of epidermis keratinocytes. Keratinocytes from these animals are substantially more responsive to exogenous IL1 than wild-type keratinocytes when stimulated in vitro. A challenge with known inducers of IL1 synthesis in keratinocytes and release causes epidermal hyperplasia and an acute dermal inflammatory cell infiltrate in the skin of mutant mice. The secondary epidermal cytokines GRO-alpha (see: MGSA) and GM-CSF are strongly induced in transgenic epidermis but not in control skin. Groves et al (1995, 1996) have generated also double transgenic mice overexpressing functional type 1 IL1 receptor and 17 kDa IL1-alpha in basal keratinocytes. These mice develop spontaneous inflammation of the skin. Secondary cytokines are more strongly induced in the double transgenic than in either parental strain. </p>
<p>Glaccum et al (1997) have demonstrated that mice with a genetically disrupted type I IL1 receptor gene (see also: Knock-out) are of normal vigor and exhibit no overt phenotype. These mice have normal serum Ig levels and show primary and secondary antibody responses equivalent to that in wild-type mice. B-cells of these mice activated in vitro with anti-IgM do not proliferate in response to IL1, but respond to IL4. Injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, but not of murine IL1-alpha, induces detectable serum IL6 levels in these mice. These mice show normal induction of acute phase proteins (see also: acute phase reaction) in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. These mice do not differ from control mice in susceptibility to either a lethal challenge with D-galactosamine plus bacterial lipopolysaccharides or high dose bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Double mutant mice lacking the type I IL1 receptor gene and the gene encoding IL1-beta Convertase are resistant to high dose bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p>Norman et al (1996) have studied the effects of IL1 on acute pancreatitis in mice lacking type 1 IL1 receptor (see also: Knock-out). Their results show that activation of the IL1 receptor is not required for the development of pancreatitis but appears to be necessary for the maximal propagation of pancreatic injury and its associated inflammation. They observe that IL1 mRNA is overproduced in organs known to produce cytokines during pancreatitis even though the pancreatitis is less severe. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an IL1-beta gene disruption have been studied by Zheng et al (1995) in transgenic knock-out mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IL1-beta gene develop normally and are apparently healthy and fertile. The animals respond normally in models of contact and delayed-type hypersensitivity or following inflammation caused by bacterial endotoxins. The animals are as resistant to Listeria monocytogenes infections as wild-type control animals. The IL1-beta mutant mice exhibit an impaired acute phase reaction and are completely resistant to fever development and anorexia, when challenged with turpentine, which normally causes localized inflammation and tissue injury. </p>
<p>Fantuzzi et al (1996) have studied also mice deficient in IL1-beta. They did not observe any differences in circulating levels for IL1-alpha, IL6, or TNF-alpha after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharides between mutant and wild-type mice. The response of mutant mice to bacterial lipopolysaccharides in terms of activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypoglycemia, serum amyloid A production, and anorexia was also normal. </p>
<p>Shornick et al (1996) have observed that defective contact hypersensitivity responses to topically applied trinitrochlorobenzene in IL1-beta deficient mice can be overcome either by application of very high doses of sensitizing antigen, or by local intradermal injection of recombinant IL1-beta immediately before antigen application. </p>
<p>Kozak et al (1995) have observed an impairment of the defense response to infection with influenza in mice lacking IL1-beta. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL1 can be detected in a number of bioassays employing several cell lines (see: A375, D10; EL4; LBRM-33; Mono Mac 6; RINm5F; RPMI 1788; T1165). IL1 can be detected also indirectly by determining concentrations of HGF (hybridoma growth factor = IL6) induced by IL1, LIF activity induced by IL1, or production of prostaglandin E2 induced by IL1 in fibroblasts. IL1 can be detected in a costimulation assay with thymocytes. It can be assayed also by sensitive ELISAs and RIAs. Intracellular IL1 is detected by two color immunofluorescence flow cytometry. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. A radioligand assay is available for the detection of IL1 receptors. </p>
<p>For an immunoassay allowing rapid determination of the rate of IL1 production under conditions preventing consumption/degradation see also: Cytokine immunotrapping. </p>
<p>For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL1 may be of clinical significance due to its activities as a stimulator of T-cells. It may be useful after massive immunosuppression and/or therapy with cytostatic drugs. IL1-alpha has been shown to accelerate the recovery of platelets after high-dose carboplatin therapy and may be clinically useful in preventing or treating thrombocytopenia induced by chemotherapy. </p>
<p>Since IL1 is involved also in hematopoiesis, acting directly on primitive hematopoietic cells and inducing the synthesis of colony stimulating factors (see: CSF), it may be useful as a stimulator of hematopoiesis either alone or in combination with other substances. Several studies suggest that combinations of IL1 and lineage specific growth factors may produce synergistic hematological effects and that IL1 may have a possible protective effect on chemotherapy induced myelosuppression. </p>
<p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with aplastic anemia show markedly decreased IL1 production. Aplastic patients with low IL1 production are distinguished by the severity of their disease and the degree of neutropenia while myelodysplastic patients with comparable degrees of pancytopenia have normal IL1 production. This deficient hematopoietic growth factor production in a bone marrow failure syndrome may contribute to the pathogenesis of some cases of aplastic anemia and to susceptibility to infection. </p>
<p>Animal experiments have shown that IL1 has radioprotective activities. IL1 enhances the capacity of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) cells to promote survival of mice given doses of radiation (1200 to 1350 cGy) that are significantly higher than those generally used for bone marrow ablation (850 to 950 cGy). IL1 may prove clinically useful, therefore, in promoting BM engraftment. </p>
<p>It has been shown that IL1 also promotes wound healing. This activity is thought to involve effects on angiogenesis, the promotion of proliferation of fibroblasts, and the chemotactic activity on neutrophils (see also: Chemotaxis). </p>
<p>The clinical application of IL1 is hampered by the very high toxicity of this compound since minute amounts of IL1 can induce septic shock. The use of IL1 receptor antagonists appears to be more promising that the use of IL1. Since elevated amounts of IL1 are found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis receptor antagonists may be of advantage (see also: IL1ra). These antagonists have been used also to prevent septic shock in experimental animals induced by IL1. They have been used also to prevent colitis in rabbits induced by immune complexes. </p>
<p>IL1-alpha may be a pathogenetic factor in the complex processes leading to vascular occlusion and an important in situ indicator of, and a potential participant in, vascular injury (see also: inflammation, wound healing). It is consistently present in all vessels with sclerotic histopathologic changes following aortocoronary bypass grafting of saphenous veins and internal mammary arteries. </p>
