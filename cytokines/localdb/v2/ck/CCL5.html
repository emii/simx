<h1>CCL5</h1>

    <h2>CCL5</h2>
    
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL5 has been described as RANTES, EoCP-1 [Eosinophil chemotactic polypeptide-1], and SIS-delta. The protein has been referred to also as TCP228 [T-cell-specific protein p228]. An older designation is SCYA5 [small inducible cytokine A5]. </p>
<p>The protein is known mainly for its activity as a chemotactic cytokine but may have a potential role in host defense as a direct antiviral agent. CCL5 has been reported to show a significant direct antiviral activity against HSV-1. It binds to HSV-1 virions via envelope glycoprotein gB and is capable of generating pores in the envelope of HSV-1 (Nakayama et al, 2006). Yang et al (2003) have shown that CCL5 is active against Gram-negative Escherichia coli. </p>

    <h2>RANTES</h2>
    
<p>[regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed, and presumably secreted] This factor of 8 kDa is called also SIS-delta (see: SIS family of cytokines), SCYA5 (see: SCY family of cytokines), and EoCP-1 (eosinophil chemotactic polypeptide). RANTES has been renamed CCL5 (see also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature of this factor). Based on the presence of a conserved three-dimensional motif and direct microbicidal activity, RANTES has been classified as a kinocidin (microbicidal chemokine). The protein has been referred to also as TCP228 [T-cell-specific protein p228]. For a synthesized N-terminally modified analog see also: P2-RANTES.  </p>
<p>At the protein level murine RANTES shows 90 % homology with human RANTES. RANTES belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (subgroup of CC-Chemokines). The human gene maps to chromosome 17q11. 2-q12 in the vicinity of other cytokine genes belonging to the group of Chemokines. 3-68 RANTES (RANTES (3-68)), which lacks two N-terminal amino acids, is generated from full-length RANTES (1-68 RANTES) (RANTES (1-68)) by cleavage with soluble CD26. 4-68 RANTES (RANTES (4-68)), which lacks three N-terminal amino acids, is generated from full-length RANTES by cleavage with unidentified enzymes associated with monocytes and neutrophils. 4-68 RANTES has reduced chemotactic activities and HIV suppressive activities (Lim et al, 2005). </p>
<p>RANTES is expressed by an early response gene. The synthesis of RANTES is induced by TNF-alpha and IL1-alpha (see: IL1) but not by TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and IL6. </p>
<p>RANTES is produced by circulating T-cells and T-cell clones in culture but not by any T-cell lines tested so far. The expression of RANTES is inhibited following stimulation of T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>RANTES is chemotactic for T-cells, human eosinophils and basophils (see also: Chemotaxis) and plays an active role in recruiting leukocytes into inflammatory sites. RANTES also activates eosinophils to release, for example, eosinophilic cationic protein. It changes the density of eosinophils and makes them hypodense, which is thought to represent a state of generalized cell activation and is associated most often with diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. RANTES also is a potent activator of oxidative metabolism specific for eosinophils. </p>
<p>RANTES increases the adherence of monocytes to endothelial cells. It selectively supports the migration (see also: Motogenic cytokines) of monocytes and T-lymphocytes expressing the cell surface markers CD4 and UCHL1. These cells are thought to be pre-stimulated T-helper cells with memory T-cell functions. RANTES activates human basophils from some select basophil donors and causes the release of histamines (see also: HRF, histamine releasing factors). On the other hand RANTES can also inhibit the release of histamines from basophils induced by several cytokines, including one of the most potent histamine inducers, MCAF. </p>
<p>RANTES has been shown recently to exhibit biological activities other than Chemotaxis. It can induce the proliferation and activation of killer cells known as CHAK (CC-Chemokine-activated killer), which are similar to cells activated by IL2 (see: LAK cells). </p>
<p>RANTES is expressed by human synovial fibroblasts and may participate, therefore, in the ongoing inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>High affinity receptors for RANTES (approximately 700 binding sites/cell; Kd = 700 picoM) have been identified on the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which responds to RANTES in Chemotaxis and calcium mobilization assays. The chemotactic response of THP-1 cells to RANTES is markedly inhibited by preincubation with MCAF (monocyte chemotactic and activating factor) or MIP-1-alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein). Binding of RANTES to monocytic cells is competed for by MCAF and MIP-1-alpha. </p>
<p>Another RANTES receptor is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, designated CCR1. It shows approximately 33 % identity with receptors for IL8 and may be the human homolog of the US28 open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus. For another viral RANTES receptor homolog see also: ECRF-3. RANTES has been shown also to bind to one of the chemokine receptors designated CCR5. RANTES has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p>Proudfoot et al (1996) have reported that the extension of recombinant human RANTES by a single residue at the amino terminus (Met-RANTES) is sufficient to produce a potent and selective antagonist, which acts as a potent antagonist of RANTES and MIP-1-alpha, both of which share the same receptor. CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>It has been observed that antibodies to RANTES can dramatically inhibit the cellular infiltration associated with experimental mesangioproliferative nephritis. In addition, RANTES appears to be expressed highly in human renal allografts undergoing cellular rejection. </p>
<p>A chemically modified form of RANTES (Aminooxypentane-linked RANTES or AOP-RANTES) has been shown to act as an antagonist for the CCR5 receptor of chemokines and to have the ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection by blocking CCR5, which serves as a coreceptor for virus entry. </p>
<p>Cocchi et al (1995) have identified MIP-1-alpha, MIP-1-beta, and RANTES as the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8(+) T-cells. </p>
<p>This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CCL5.
