    <h2>CSF-2</h2>
    
<p>[Colony stimulating factor-2] This factor was described initially as an activity promoting the development of colonies containing macrophages and granulocytes in a colony formation assay (see also: CSF for general information about colony stimulating factors). It is isolated from cultured murine lung cells and human squamous cells line CHU-2. </p>
<p>The factor is identical with GM-CSF. </p>

    <h2>CSF</h2>
    
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) cell scattering factors. See: Motogenic cytokines. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) colony stimulating factors </p>
<p>colony stimulating activities, also abbr. CSA. </p>
<p>This term goes back to experiments carried out in the 60ies, which attempted to grow colonies of bone marrow cells immobilized in soft agar or methyl cellulose (see also: Colony formation assay). It was found that Feeder cell layers and also the supplementation of the growth media with conditioned medium considerably promoted colony growth, suggesting the existence of colony stimulating factors secreted by the cells. </p>
<p>While hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis) could be maintained only for short periods of time in the absence of such factors, their presence allowed the development of colonies containing erythroid cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and megakaryocytes (see also: CFU, colony-forming unit). The biochemical analysis of various activities stimulating colony formation supporting the growth and development of these cell types revealed that there existed many different and distinct factors of this sort. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors belong to the group of regulatory proteins and peptides known as cytokines. Many of these factors are either N- or O-glycosylated. Glycosylation has been shown to enhance the solubility, stability and resistance to proteolytic enzymes. It does not appear to be required for the full spectrum of biological activities of these factors (see also: Recombinant cytokines). The genes encoding many of the human colony stimulating factors have been cloned and mapped. Some of the genes are in close vicinity but they do not show great homology among each other with the exception of some conserved regions. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors are produced by many different cell types, including, for example, B-lymphocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, bonemarrow stromal cells, T-lymphocytes. They are synthesized as precursor molecules containing a classical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of approximately 25-32 amino acids (see also: gene expression). </p>
<p>The secreted factors have an extremely high specific biological activity (10**8 - 10**9 units/mg protein) and are, therefore, active at very low concentrations (1-100 pM). These factors are absolutely required for the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The concentrations required for mere maintenance of viability are usually orders of magnitude lower than those required to induce cell proliferation or to elicit specific functional activities of the cells. </p>
<p>The names of the individual factors usually indicate the cell types that respond to these factors. The classical colony stimulating factors include M-CSF (specific for macrophages), G-CSF (specific for granulocytes), GM-CSF (specific for macrophages and granulocytes), IL3 (multifunctional) and MEG-CSA (specific for megakaryocytes). G-CSF and M-CSF are lineage-specific while GM-CSF and IL3 are multifunctional hematopoietic growth factors acting on earlier stages of differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Some of the biological activities of colony stimulating factors are concentration-dependent, i.e., biological activities may differ depending upon whether low or high concentrations of the corresponding factors act on the cells. In addition, the activities of many of these factors can be synergised and antagnoized by other factors. </p>
<p>Factors such as Epo, which is involved in erythropoiesis, but also most of the factors known as Interleukins, are not classified as colony stimulating factors. In combination with colony-forming factors they constitute the group of so-called hematopoietins (hematopoietic growth factors). </p>
<p>The synthesis of colony stimulating factors can be stimulated by immunological reactions and products of infectious agents. In some cell types their synthesis can be stimulated by a factor of up to 1000. The induction of synthesis may be direct or a consequence of the activity of other hematopoietic factors. The synthesis of IL1, for example, is induced by bacterial endotoxins or foreign antigens, and IL1, in turn, is capable of stimulating the synthesis of various colony stimulating factors. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors may act as differentiation factors initiating the irreversible terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Colony stimulating factors also induce the synthesis of many other growth factors and play an important role in the maintenance of membrane integrity and cell viability. The proliferation of mature cells is usually not influenced by these factors, they may, however, prolong their life span. Apart from their actions on a number of hematopoietic cell types colony stimulating factors also influence other cell types. </p>
<p>The stimulation of hematopoietic cells in particular by colony stimulating factors is the basis of their clinical use in patients suffering from diverse forms of hematopoietic disorders. The use of molecular biological techniques, culminating in the cloning and expression of the genes encoding the colony stimulating factors has been instrumental in this development. Most of these factors are now available in highly purified form and in sufficient amounts allowing an assessment of their therapeutical efficacy and their use in the clinic (see also: Recombinant cytokines. </p>
<p>The use of these mediators opens ways of reconstituting aberrant hematopoietic processes in a physiological manner. This includes more or less all varieties of disorders, which are characterized either by an insufficient maturation of blood cells or by a reduced production of leukocytes. The fact that different cell types vary in their responses to individual colony stimulating factors can be used to expand differentially defined populations of progenitor cells. On the one hand, these factors can be used to correct chemotherapy induced cytopenias. Colony stimulating factors can be used to counteract cytopenia-related predisposition to infections and hemorrhages. Since these factors are capable also of influencing the growth cycle of many malignant cell types, many of them showing at least tumoricidal activities, colony stimulating factors may be used also in the directed treatment of various cancers either alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs. </p>
<p>The major advantage of treatments involving the use of colony stimulating factors is certainly the more or less physiological reconstitution of hematopoietic processes. So far there are no indications that treatments with these factors lead to an exhaustion of the normal stem cell population in the bone marrow or to the proliferation on non-myeloid tumors (see also: hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p>A novel concept is the so-called peripheral stem cell separation. This technique involves the expansion of peripheral stem cells by in vivo pretreatment with suitable colony stimulating factors and their subsequent collection. These cells can be re-infused at a later time to normalize blood parameters, following, for example, extensive courses of drug treatment. </p>
<p>Available colony stimulating factors can be used in different clinical stettings and the entire spectrum of clinical indications is only just now emerging. </p>

    <h2>GM-CSF</h2>
    
<p>[Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor] </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>BPA (burst promoting activity); CSF-alpha (colony stimulating factor-alpha); CSF-beta (colony stimulating factor-beta); CSF-2 (colony stimulating factor-2); Eo-CSF (eosinophil colony stimulating factor); Eosinophil viability-enhancing activity; ESP (eosinophil stimulation promoter); FDCP1 growth factor (= rat GM-CSF); GM-CSA (Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating activity); HCGF (Hematopoietic cell growth factor); HCSF (histamine-producing cell stimulating factor); HPIF (histamine-production-increasing factor); KM102-BPA (KM102 burst promoting activity); KTGF (Keratinocyte-derived T-cell growth factor); LBGF (leukemic blast growth factor); MFF (macrophage fusion factor); MGI-1GM (macrophage-granulocyte inducer); NIF-T (Neutrophil migration inhibition factor from T-lymphocytes); T-cell derived neutrophil migration inhibition factor; Pluripoietin-alpha; TPO (thrombopoietin); WEHI-3B differentiation inducing activity. Recombinant GM-CSF is also marketed under the generic names Sargramostim and Molgramostim and under the brand names Leukomax, Leukine, and Prokine. </p>
<p>See also: individual entries for further information (see also: Recombinant cytokines). </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>This protein is secreted together with other factors by T-cells and macrophages following cell activation by antigens or mitogens. Approximately 90 % of the secreted colony stimulating activities are due GM-CSF (see also: CSF). </p>
<p>The synthesis of GM-CSF by various other cell types, for example, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, is inducible by TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, IL1, IL2 and IFN. Some cell types express GM-CSF constitutively. Constitutive synthesis may be the result also of promoter insertion mutations (see: IAP, intracisternal A particles). </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>GM-CSF is a monomeric protein of 127 amino acids with two glycosylation sites. The protein is synthesized as a precursor of 144 amino acids, which included a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence at the aminoterminal end. The sugar moiety is not required for the full spectrum of biological activities. Non-glycosylated and glycosylated GM-CSF show the same activities in vitro. Fully glycosylated GM-CSF is biologically more active in vivo than the non-glycosylated protein. The different molecular weight forms of GM-CSF (14 kDa, 35 kDa) described in the literature are the result of varying degrees of glycosylation. GM-CSF contains four cysteine residues (positions 54/96 and 88/121). </p>
<p>A comparison of the protein sequence of GM-CSF with those of the other colony stimulating factors reveals that they are not related to each other. Human and murine GM-CSF display 60 % homology at the protein level and 70 % at the nucleotide level. The two factors do not, however, cross-react immunologically. </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be associated with the extracellular matrix of cells as a complex with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This allows storage of the factor in a biologically inactive form. The exact mechanism by which the factor is eventually released from these depots is not known. </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be expressed also as an integral membrane protein. The membrane-bound or matrix-associated forms of the factor can interact with receptors on other nearby cells. This effectively establishes cell-to-cell contacts and may induce biological activities also in juxtaposed cells (see: juxtacrine). </p>
<p>E21R is an mutated analog of GM-CSF which selectively binds to the alpha chain of the receptor and behaves as a competitive GM-CSF antagonist. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human gene has a length of approximately 2. 5 kb and contains four exons. The distance between the GM-CSF gene and the IL3 gene is approximately 9 kb. </p>
<p>The human GM-CSF gene maps to chromosome 5q22-31 in the vicinity of other genes encoding hematopoietic growth factors (M-CSF, IL3, IL4, IL5) and the gene encoding the M-CSF receptor (see also: 5q minus syndrome). </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that deletions of the IL3 and GM-CSF locus are observed frequently in patients 5q minus syndrome. The biological significance of these deletions is, however, unclear. </p>
<p>The 5' region of the GM-CSF gene contains several sequence elements known as CLE (conserved lymphokine element). They function as binding sites for transcription factors (see also: gene expression) modulating the expression of the GM-CSF gene. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>GM-CSF receptors are expressed at densities of several 100 to several 1000 copies/cell on the cell surface of myeloid cells. The receptor is expressed also on non-hematopoietic cells such as endothelial cells and small cell lung carcinoma cells. </p>
<p>Lymphoid cells and erythroid cells do not appear to express the receptor. In receptor-positive cell lineages the receptor density decreases with increasing degrees of maturation. </p>
<p>The receptor shows significant homologies with other receptors for hematopoietic growth factors, including IL2-beta, IL3, IL6, IL7, Epo and the Prolactin receptors (see also: Cytokine receptor families). </p>
<p>One cloned subunit of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-Ralpha, 45 kDa) binds GM-CSF with low affinity. The second subunit (GM-Rbeta, 120 kDa) does not bind GM-CSF. GM-Ralpha is a protein of 400 amino acids that contains only a short cytoplasmic domain of 54 amino acids. The high affinity GM-CSF receptor is formed by the aggregation of the two receptor subunits. </p>
<p>The GM-Rbeta subunit of the receptor is also a constituent of other cytokine receptor systems. It is a component of the high affinity receptors for IL3 and IL5, both of which also contain a cytokine-specific subunit (see also: AIC2A, common beta). In the nomenclature of CD antigens this common protein has been given the designation CD131. A soluble form of the GM-CSF receptor has been described also. See also the Transgenic /Knock-out/Antisense Studies section of this entry for details on mice not expressing the common beta subunit of the receptor complex. </p>
<p>For a protein involved in signal transduction see also: CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human GM-CSF is not active on murine cells and vice versa. GM-CSF was isolated initially as a factor stimulating the growth of colonies of macrophages and granulocytes in soft agar cultures (see also: Colony formation assay). GM-CSF is indispensable for the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages. It stimulates myeloblasts and monoblasts and triggers irreversible differentiation of these cells. GM-CSF synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells. In combination with another colony stimulating factor, M-CSF, one observes the phenomenon of synergistic suppression, i.e., the combination of these two factors leads to a partial suppression of the generation of macrophage-containing cell colonies. </p>
<p>For some types of blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia GM-CSF acts as an autocrine mediator of growth. GM-CSF is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils (see also: Chemotaxis). It enhances microbicidal activity, oxidative metabolism, and phagocytotic activity of neutrophils and macrophages. It also improves the cytotoxicity of these cells. </p>
<p>GM-CSF displays a less pronounced specificity than, for example, G-CSF. It stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of precursors of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. It also functionally activates the corresponding mature forms, enhancing, for example, to the expression of certain cell surface adhesion proteins (CD11a, CD11b). The overexpression of these proteins could be one explanation for the observed local accumulation of granulocytes at sites of inflammation. In addition, GM-CSF also enhances expression of receptors for fMLP (Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) which is a stimulator of the activity of neutrophils. </p>
<p>At pico- to nanomolar concentrations GM-CSF is chemotactic for eosinophils and also influences the chemotactic behavior of these cells in response to other chemotactic factors (see also: Chemotaxis). </p>
<p>In granulocytes GM-CSF stimulates the release of arachidonic acid metabolites and the increased generation of reactive oxygen species. The activation of the Na+/H+ antiport system leads to a rapid alkalization of the cytosol. Phagocytotic activities of neutrophil granulocytes and the cytotoxicity of eosinophils is also enhanced considerably by GM-CSF. Since GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) present at sites of inflammatory responses it can be assumed that it is an important mediator for inflammatory reactions. </p>
<p>The functional state of Langerhans cells of the skin is influenced also by GM-CSF. These cells are not capable of initiating primary immune responses, for example, contact sensibilization. They are converted to highly potent immunostimulatory dendritic cells by GM-CSF (and also IL1). Langerhans cells therefore form an in situ reservoir for immunologically immature lymphoid dendritic cells. The maturation of these cells, which is seen as an increased ability to process antigens, can be downregulated by TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>At nanomolar concentrations GM-CSF induces the expression of Complement C3a receptors on basophils. Cells that normally do not respond to C3a and that have been activated by GM-CSF, degranulate in response to the C3a stimulus. This is accompanied by the release of histamine and leukotriene C4. This process may be of significance in hypersensitivity reactions associated with inflammatory responses (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells). GM-CSF has been shown also to be a potent inducer of trophoblast interferon (see: TP-1). </p>
<p>GM-CSF synergises with some other cytokines, including IL1, IL3 and G-CSF. GM-CSF and G-CSF must act in concert to allow the development in vitro of colonies containing neutrophils. </p>
<p>IL3 by itself only negligibly expands the number of circulating blood cells; a subsequent dose of GM-CSF, however, significantly increases cell numbers, probably because IL3 first leads to an expansion of those cells capable of responding to GM-CSF. </p>
<p>The observations that most cell lines that depend on exogenous IL3 (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) can also grow in the presence of GM-CSF and IL4 and that several synergistic effects are observed between GM-CSF and IL4 suggest that these three factors perform similar functions in controlling the growth of cells. There are some indications that the mechanism of signal transduction contains at least some common factors. </p>
<p>Experiments with tyrosine-specific protein kinases encoded by an oncogene have shown that the expression of this kinase activity in factor-dependent cells abolishes their dependence on GM-CSF, IL3 and IL4. The exact mechanism by which these factors regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cells is still unknown. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of GM-CSF have been studied in transgenic mice harboring a constitutively expressed GM-CSF gene. The overexpression of the transgene encoding GM-CSF leads to pathological alterations in the retina and causes blindness and also causes muscle deterioration. These mice are characterized by a very pronounced increase in activated macrophages. In addition, the overexpression of GM-CSF leads to the activation of mature macrophages secreting large amounts of IL1 and TNF, suggesting that these cytokines may be responsible for some aspects of the transgenic mouse disease. </p>
<p>Histopathological examination demonstrates a pronounced increase in the population of progenitor cells of the monocytic lineage. GM-CSF-transgenic animals usually die within months from the massive tissue damages (see also: inflammation, wound healing) resulting from the overexpression of these factors. Similar results have been obtained with mice possessing a bone marrow manipulated to overexpress GM-CSF by transformation with suitable retrovirus vectors. These findings do not seem to be of clinical significance, though. The long-term treatment of primates and mice with GM-CSF has shown that life-threatening complications do not occur. For aspects of leukemic conversion of non-leukemic cells in GM-CSF-transgenic animals see: FDCP1. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an GM-CSF gene disruption have been studied in mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Knock-out mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the GM-CSF gene are characterized by an unimpaired steady-state hematopoiesis, demonstrating that GM-CSF is not essential for maintaining normal levels of the major types of mature hematopoietic cells and their precursors in blood, marrow, and spleen (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Most GM-CSF deficient mice are superficially healthy and fertile but develop abnormal lungs. GM-CSF deficient mice develop a progressive accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins in the alveolar space, the defining characteristics of the idiopathic human disorder pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Extensive lymphoid hyperplasia associated with lung airways and blood vessels is found also. These results demonstrate an unexpected, critical role for GM-CSF in pulmonary homeostasis. </p>
<p>Robb et al (1995) have created transgenic knock-out mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding the common beta subunit (beta C) of the GM-CSF, IL3, and IL5 receptor complexes. Homozygous deletion mutants exhibit normal development and survive to young adult life. They develop pulmonary peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis. Eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone marrow of homozygous deletion mutants are reduced, while other hematological parameters are normal. Bone marrow cells from homozygous deletion mutants do not show high-affinity binding of GM-CSF, while cells from heterozygous animals show an intermediate number of high-affinity receptors. In clonal cultures of bone marrow cells derived from homozygous deletion mutants, even high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL5 do not stimulate colony formation (see also: Colony formation assay). Differences in the systemic clearance and distribution of GM-CSF between mutant and wild-type littermates are not observed. </p>
<p>Nishinakamura et al (1996) have crossed beta-c mutant mice with mice deficient for IL3. The double-mutant mice lacking all IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 functions are apparently normal and fertile. The animals show the same reduced numbers of eosinophils and a lack of eosinophilic response to parasites as beta-c mutant mice. The immune response of the double mutant mice to Listeria mono-cytogenes is normal. Hematopoietic recovery after treatment with Fluorouracil is also normal. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanism to produce blood cells that do not depend on the presence of IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be assayed in a colony formation assay by the development of colonies containing macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and megakaryocytes (see also: Colony formation assay). GM-CSF is also detected in specific bioassays with cells lines that depend in their growth on the presence of GM-CSF or that respond to this factor (see: AML-193; B6SUt-A; BAC1.2F5; BCL1; Da; FDCP1; GF-D8; GM/SO; IC-2; MO7E; NFS-60; PT-18; TALL-103; TF-1; UT-7). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The usual dose, route and schedules for GM-CSF are 5-10 micrograms/kg/day either by 4-6 hours intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection. At such doses, adverse effects are predominantly mild-to-moderate in nature, occur in 20-30 % of patients and usually comprise fever, myalgia, malaise, rash and injection site reaction. Intravenous bolus or short infusions of GM-CSF are more likely to promote adverse effects. Some side effects are probably not due to direct actions of GM-CSF but are caused by the GM-CSF induced secretion of other cytokines such as TNF, IL1 and IL6 (see also: acute phase reaction, acute phase proteins). </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be employed for the physiological reconstitution of hematopoiesis in all diseases characterized either by an aberrant maturation of blood cells or by a reduced production of leukocytes. The main and most important clinical application of GM-CSF is probably the treatment of life-threatening neutropenia following chemo- and/or radiotherapy, which is markedly reduced under GM-CSF treatment. GM-CSF can be used also to correct chemotherapy induced cytopenias and to counteract cytopenia-related predisposition to infections and hemorrhages. </p>
<p>In order to avoid potential complications following the administration of GM-CSF careful clinical monitoring is required in certain patient groups, for example those with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, inflammatory disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia or malfunctional immunological responsiveness. </p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the use of GM-CSF enhances tolerance to cytotoxic drug treatment and can be used to prevent dose reductions necessitated by the side effects of cytotoxic drug treatment. GM-CSF treatment frequently permits to increase the doses of cytotoxic drugs per course. These studies have revealed also a significantly reduced morbidity under GM-CSF treatment. </p>
<p>There are no indications that the treatment with hematopoietic growth factors induces a depletion of the stem cell population or the expansion of non-myeloid tumor cells. It has been observed, however, that GM-CSF treatment may lead to a transient expansion of clonogenic blast cells in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. The expansion of malignant clones is reversible if GM-CSF is withdrawn. </p>
<p>One of the advantages of GM-CSF treatment may be the induction of differentiation and the activation of resting leukemic cells to enter the cell cycle where they are susceptible to cell cycle-specific drugs. </p>
<p>At present, GM-CSF represents an important advance in bone marrow transplantation and has become a standard therapy. The drug can be given safely and does not appear to increase the risk of graft-versus-host disease or tumor relapse. GM-CSF enhances the reconstitution of the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis) in patients undergoing autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplantation and patients with delayed engraftment after bone marrow transplantation. The beneficial effects of GM-CSF following autologous bone marrow transplantation consist not only of a shorter period of absolute neutropenia, but also fewer significant infections, a diminished requirement for intravenous antibiotic administration, and a shorter overall duration of inpatient hospitalization. Since GM-CSF leads to a marked expansion of the peripheral pool of stem cells this may be an alternative also to traditional methods of collecting large amounts of these cells. </p>
<p>Some animal experiments suggest that the effects of lethal irradiation can be abolished by a timely administration of GM-CSF and that the complete reconstitution of hematopoiesis is possible. At present data from human irradiated patients are not yet available. </p>
<p>Fusion proteins consisting of GM-CSF and tumor-derived tumor-specific variable regions of the immunoglobulin molecules expressed on malignant B-cells have been constructed. These chimaeric tumor idiotypic proteins are strong immunogens that induce idiotype-specific antibodies without other carrier proteins or adjuvants. They have been shown to protect recipient animals from challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of B-lymphoma tumor cells. It has been suggested that this approach may be applicable to the design of vaccines for a variety of other diseases. For other fusion proteins converting weakly immunogenic antigens into potent immunogens see: IL2 (subentry Clinical use AND Significance). </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional GM-CSF gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>Ye et al (1997) have constructed a fusion protein consisting of GM-CSF and MCAF. The recombinant human fusion protein can sustain the growth of the cell line TF-1 that depends on the continuous presence of GM-CSF (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). The recombinant protein is also chemotactic for monocytes. In vitro the fusion protein activates monocytes to inhibit the growth of several human tumor cell lines. The fusion protein is more effective in inducing cytotoxicity of monocytes than GM-CSF or MCAF alone or than a combination of GM-CSF and MCAF. The fusion protein also completely suppresses tumor formation in nude mice. </p>
