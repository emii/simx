<h1>T-cells</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>These cells (called also T-lymphocytes) are among the most abundant types of white blood cells (lymphocytes). T-cells are highly specialized cells that have the capacity to bind to bind to an antigenic determinant (epitope) of a cell-bound antigen by means of the T-cell receptor (TCR). The cells presenting the cell surface antigen recognized by the T-cell receptor are called antigen-presenting cell (APC). The designation Tconv [conventional T-cells] is used frequently to distinguish these cells, which provide clonal antigen-specific responses, from more specialized subpopulations, referred to sometimes as unconventional T-cells, such as regulatory T-cells, NKT-cells or MAIT cells (Pennington et al, 2005; Gapin, 2009). </p>
<p>T-cells develop from T-lymphoid precursor cells. The earliest progenitors of T-cells are produced in the bone marrow. These cells are called T-cells because the development and selection of mature immunologically competent T-cells occurs in the thymus. During their residence in the thymus, precursors of T-cells develop into thymocytes. The thymus can be divided into an outer cortex and inner medulla. Immature thymocytes are present in the outer cortex of the thymus. Mature thymocytes are present in the inner medulla of the thymus. </p>
<p>Thymocytes divide rapidly and their numbers increase enormously in a relatively short period of time. Thymocytes pass from the cortex to the medulla before emerging as immunocompetent cells in the peripheral circulation. The predominant thymocyte subsets in the medulla are CD4(+) CD8(-) and CD4(-) CD8(+) cells, which leave the thymus to populate the periphery. In the context of T-cell biology these cells are variously referred to as single-positive cells (single-positive thymocytes) or single-negative cells (single-negative thymocytes). Specialized complexes of thymic stromal epithelial cells and CD4(+) CD8(+) thymocytes in the cortex, called 'nurse cells', may provide a specialized microenvironment for the development of thymocyte. The corticomedullary junction - the boundary between cortex and medulla is rich in macrophages and dendritic cells. The macrophages prevent the passage of damaged or dying cells into the medulla. Dendritic cells are important for the negative selection of T-cells in the thymus. Thymocytes that leave the thymus take up residence in areas of the lymph nodes and spleen called T-dependent zones. From this time on they are known as T-cells. </p>
<p>Two distinct lineages of T-cells are generated in the thymus. They are identified by the two different types of T-cell receptors they express. The first cells to develop are so-called Gamma-Delta T-cells. These are prominent during embryonic thymic development, represent a small minority population of T-cells in the peripheral blood but a major subset in other anatomical locations, and their development may involve also extrathymic sites. Ribot et al (2009) have shown that most Gamma-Delta T-cells express CD27 and secrete IFN-gamma, whereas IL17 production is restricted to CD27(-)Gamma-Delta T-cells. For skin-resident cells see: dendritic epidermal T-cells. Meissner et al (2003) have reported expression profiles for Gamma-Delta T-cells. </p>
<p>Alpha-Beta T-cells represent the majority of thymocytes in the thymus and T-cells in the periphery. With regard to effector functions, there are no major differences between Gamma-Delta T-cells and Alpha-Beta T-cells. However, The two cell types are thought to differ from each other in terms of the ligands recognized by the two different kinds of T-cell receptors (Kabelitz et al, 2007; Hayday, 2000). Subtypes of activated human Gamma-Delta T-cells, referred to as Vdelta1(+) T-cells (resident cells) and Vdelta2(+) T-cells (circulating cells; called also Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T-cells), appears to function as antigen-presenting cells with a potency and efficacy similar to tat observed for dendritic cells. (Moser and Brandes, 2006; Ferrarini et al, 2002). These cells use the T-cell receptor as a pattern recognition receptor to sense infections and also respond to microbial metabolites (Beetz et al, 2008). </p>
<p>Immature thymocytes undergo a selection process in the thymus. Two types of functionally different T-cells are distinguished depending on the type of glycoprotein cell surface marker (CD4 or CD8) they express on their cell surface. Immature T-cells do not express a T-cell receptor and also do not express CD4 or CD8. Such cells are called double-negative cells [double-negative thymocytes, double-negative T-cells, DN cells, DN thymocytes]. In the cortex of the thymus these cells begin to express T-cell receptor, and CD4 as well as CD8 (double-positive thymocytes, double-positive T-cells, double-positive cells, DP cells, DP thymocytes). Double-positive cells differentiate by a process of positive selection into cell types that express either CD4 or CD8. These cells migrate to the medulla of the thymus. Cells that have the capacity to recognize self-antigens in conjunction with MHC molecules are eliminated by negative selection. Surviving cells leave the thymus and eventually participate in immune reponses against foreign antigens. Positive selection is mediated by cortical epithelial cells and ensures that mature T-cells have the potential to recognise foreign peptide in association with self-MHC. Negative selection removes potentially dangerous T-cells that recognise self-peptides. These cells undergo cell death by apoptosis. </p>
<p>T-cells expressing CD4 bind epitopes of antigens that are presented on the surface of cells in a complex with class 2 histocompatibility molecules (B-cells, phagocytic cells such as macrophages, and dendritic cells). Upon binding to another cell, these T-cells release other cytokines that are chemotactic for a variety of other cell types, which then migrate to this area and cause inflammation. These cell-to-cell interactions and the mediators that are released during this process are responsible for the process of cell-mediated immunity. Special CD4(+) cells, called T-helper cells, bind to antigens presented on B-cells and are responsible for antibody-mediated immunity. These helper T-cell populations have been shown to comprise distinct subpopulations that are being referred to generally as polarized T-cells, which differ in their expression profiles. For examples see: Th0 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th3 cells, Th5 cells, Th6 cells, Th9 cells, Th17 cells, Th22 cells. T-cells expressing CD8 bind epitopes of antigens that are presented on the surface of cells in a complex with class 1 histocompatibility molecules (most cell types of the body). One example of such cells are cytotoxic T-cells (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, abbr. CTL), which have the capacity to secrete factors such as granzymes and perforins and others, which destroy the cell to which they have bound. Subtypes of cytotoxic T-cells are known as Tc1 cells and Tc2 cells. They are distinguished by the types of receptors they express and by the types of cytokines they secrete. Maekawa et al (2008) have shown T-cells lacking expression of that Notch-2 have impaired differentiation into cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>For a special subpopulation of T-cells that have the capability of suppressing immune responses see: regulatory T-cells (suppressor T-cells). </p>
<p>Wang et al (2008) have compared the expression profiles of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T-cells and have identified a number of genes involved in cell activation of T-cells. Cao et al (2010) have reported a comparison of gene expression profiles of CD8(+) T-cells from aged and young healthy subjects. </p>
<p> Currently, the list below does not distinguish between individual subclasses or subpopulations of T-cells. T-cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
