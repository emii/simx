<h1>NK-cells</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>[natural killer cells] These cells are being referred to also as large granular lymphocytes (abbr. LGL). For a subpopulation of NK-cells associated with the uterus see also: granulated metrial gland cells (GMG cells) and endometrial granulocytes (uterine NK-cells). For a subpopulation of non-cytolytic NK-cells with immunoregulatory functions see: NK-ireg cells. For a subset of NK-cells with features of memory cells see: Memory NK-cells. </p>
<p>NK-cells are innate immune cells involved in tumor surveillance, immunity against viruses, and IFN-gamma secretion (Colucci et al, 2003). NK-cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that can lyse various types of target cells (tumor cells or virus-infected cells, for example) without prior sensitization. In addition, NK-cells are important sources of cytokines and chemokines. The term ANK-cells is used frequently to refer to NK-cells after cell activation by IL2. For a subpopulation of cytolytic T-lymphocytes with activities of NK-cells see: NK-CTL. </p>
<p>Based on the extent to which NK-cells express the marker CD56, two subpopulations can be distinguished (Ferlazzo, 2008; Robertson and Ritz, 1990; Poli et al, 2009; Cooper et al, 2001). CD56(dim) CD16(+) NK-cells (CD56(dim) CD16(bright) NK-cells) are predominant in peripheral blood, display potent cytolytic activity, and constitute the major subset (90 %). CD56(bright) NK-cells that are either CD16(+) or CD16(-) constitute a small percentage (5-10 %) of the circulating NK-cell population, predominate in tissues and secondary lymphoid organs, are poorly cytolytic, and appear to have mainly immunoregulatory functions (see: regulatory NK-cells). They are thought to be responsible for cytokine production, primarily IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, in addition to other cytokines and chemokines (GM-CSF, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5) (Caligiuri, 2008; Moretta et al, 2008; Fauriat et al, 2010). They constitutively express high affinity IL2 receptors and expand in vitro and in vivo in response to low (picomolar) doses of IL2 but do not themselves make IL2 (Caligiuri et al, 1990, 1993).  </p>
<p>The cytolytic potential of NK-cells is either inhibited or activated by recognition of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on target cells. Target cell recognition involves a variety of C-type lectin proteins (Trinchieri et al, 1989; French and Yokoyama, 2003). NK-cell responses are activated or inhibited by recognizing HLA class I molecules on target cells. This is mediated by a great number of polymorphic killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR family) expressed on NK-cells (for examples see: CD158). </p>
<p>NK-cells are bone marrow-derived cells and develop from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells. These stem cells give rise to common progenitors of lymphoid cells that then develop into bipotential progenitor cells with the capacity to develop into either NK-cells or T-cells. NK-cells develop from these common precursors. These precursors lose their capacity to develop into NK-cells after they have begun to rearrange the genes for the T-cell receptor (Spits et al, 1998). pre-NK-cells express only the marker CD161. Cells that express CD161 and CD56 are immature NK-cells. Mature NK-cells express CD161, CD56, and CD94 (Spits et al, 1998). Lytic pseudo-mature NK-cells have been defined as cells expressing markers of mature NK-cells (NK1.1 and DX5 in mice, CD56 in humans, CD94 / NKG2 receptors in both species) but not Ly49 receptors or KIR receptors (Williams et al, 1997; Sivori et al, 2002).  </p>
<p>NK-cells can be differentiated from other cytotoxic lymphocytes such as MHC restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (abbr. CTL), NK-like T-cells (MHC-unrestricted CTL), and NKT-cells by several criteria. They have a large granular lymphocyte morphology, do not express CD3, express CD56, display MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity (i.e., they kill their target cells nonspecifically, and have a germ-line configuarion of the T-cell receptor genes (Trinchieri et al, 1989). Two types of peripheral blood NK-cells are distinguished by their expression of CD56: cells specializing in cytolysis are CD56(low). CD56(high) cells favor cytokine secretion (Cooper et al, 2001).  </p>
<p>Most studies with NK-cells have been performed with cells obtained from human peripheral blood or mouse spleens. NK-cells are found also in other anatomical locations, including lung, intestine, lymph nodes, bone marrow and liver (see: pit cells). Cells from these locations may differ from NK-cells in the blood in terms of morphology and function and may display considerably different cell surface phenotypes and expression patterns (Cooper et al, 2001; Jonges et al, 2001; Vermijlen et al, 2004). </p>
<p>Peritt et al (1998) have reported that human NK-cells cultured in the presence of IL12 or IL4 differentiate into cell populations with the same cytotoxic activity but distinct patterns of cytokine secretion similar to Th1 cells and Th2 cells. NK1 cells are obtained when NK-cells are grown in IL12 in the presence of antibodies neutralizing IL4. These cells produce IL10 and IFN-gamma. NK2 cells are obtained when NK-cells are grown in IL4 in the presence of antibodies neutralizing IL12. These cells produce IL5 and IL13. Neither subset expresses IL2, IL4, IL14, IL15, or IL9. Similar findings have been reported by Deniz et al (2002). </p>
<p> NK-22 cells constitute a subset of human NK-cells located in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as tonsils and Peyer's patches (Cella et al, 2009). These cells are characterized by expression of IL22, IL26, and LIF. NK-22 cells are triggered by acute exposure to IL23. In vitro, cytokines secreted by NK-22 cells stimulate epithelial cells to secrete IL10, proliferate and express a variety of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic molecules. NK-22 cells are found also in mouse mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and appear in the small intestine lamina propria during bacterial infection, suggesting that NK-22 cells provide an innate source of IL22 that may help constrain inflammation and protect mucosal sites. </p>
<p> Hanna et al (2004) have reported expression profile comparisons of peripheral blood-derived CD56(dim) CD16(+), CD56(bright) CD16(-), and in vitro-activated CD16(+) NK-cells.  </p>
<p>NK-cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
