<p>The recommended name for bFGF is FGF-2 (see: Nomenclature Meeting Report and Recommendation, January 18, 1991, reprinted in: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Vol. 638, pages xiii-xvi). (for some personal views of problems associated with nomenclature see also: Some personal remarks). </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>bFGF is found in almost all tissues of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origin and also in tumors derived from these tissues. Endothelial cells produce large amounts of this factor. Some bFGF is associated with the extracellular matrix of the subendothelial cells. Many cells express bFGF only transiently and store it in a biologically inactive form. The mechanism by which the factor is released by the cells is not known. It is released after tissue injuries and during inflammatory processes (see also: inflammation, wound healing) and also during the proliferation of tumor cells. The expression of bFGF and related factors seems to be regulated differentially, depending on cell type and developmental age. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>bFGF is an 18 kDa protein with a length of 155 amino acids and an isoelectric point of 9.6. The factor does not contain disulfide bonds and is not glycosylated. Shorter variants with a length of 131 and 146 amino acids, respectively, have been described. The 18 kDa protein is obtained by using the classical AUG initiation codon. Some higher molecular weight forms of bFGF (22, 23, 24, 25 kDa) have been described also. They arise by translation beginning at a CUG codon. The smallest form (18 kDa) occurs predominantly in the cytosol, while the higher molecular weight forms (22, 22.5, 24 kDa) are associated with the nucleus and ribosomes. A variant isoform of bFGF associated with the endopaslmic reticulum has been designated altFGF-2. </p>
<p>bFGF is related to another member of the FGF family, aFGF and shows a homology of 55 % which is limited, however, to a few functional domains. The structure of bFGF, revealed by X-ray crystallography, shows a similar folding structure as IL1. </p>
<p>The sequences of bovine and human bFGF differ in only 2 amino acids. Human and ovine bFGF are identical. A homolog of human bFGF isolated from Xenopus laevis shows an overall sequence homology of 84 %. </p>
<p>bFGF, like aFGF, CNTF (ciliary neuronotrophic factor), and PD-ECGF (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor), does not possess a signal sequence that would allow secretion of the factor by classical secretion pathways (endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi system). Schfer et al (2004) have provided evidence showing that bFGF secretion is based on its direct translocation across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The higher molecular weight forms differ from the 18 kDa form of bFGF in their N-terminal ends. These ends contain a signal sequence known as nuclear targeting sequence which is responsible for the localization of the factor in the cell nucleus. A mechanism of growth control called intracrine has been proposed to account for some of the actions of bFGF. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The bFGF gene has a length of approximately 38 kb and contains three exons separated by three large introns. The first intron separated codons 60 and 61, the second intron codons 94 and 95. The bFGF gene codes for a total of four polypeptides, three of which using initiation from non-AUG codons. The human bFGF gene is located on chromosome 4q25. Some cells appear to express two polyadenylated different transcripts of 3.7 and 7 kb. </p>
<p>RELATED FACTORS </p>
<p>bFGF is the prototype of a large family of proteins, designated FGF family (see also: gene family). Its members display a remarkable affinity to heparin and are therefore called also HBGF (heparin binding growth factors). See also: FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-3, FGF-4, FGF-5, FGF-6, FGF-7, FGF-8, FGF-9, FGF-10, FGF-11, FGF-12, FGF-13, FGF-14, FGF-15, FGF-16, FGF-17, FGF-18, FGF-19, FGF-20, FGF-21, FGF-22, FGF-23, and HBGF-1, HBGF-2, HBGF-3, HBGF-4, HBGF-5, HBGF-6, HBGF-7, HBGF-8, HBGF-9. </p>
<p>FGF proteins have been conserved closely in evolution. Some Oncogene proteins identified in gastric, mammary, and bladder carcinomas and Kaposi sarcomas (see: int-2, hst, K-FGF) are biologically active growth factors related to bFGF. These factors and bFGF show an overall sequence homology of 30-45 %. A factor designated keratinocyte growth factor (KGF = FGF-7) and two additional factors each encoded by an oncogene, designated FGF-5 and FGF-6, are also members of the FGF family. Several related factors have been described as Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (see: FHF). </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>FGF receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of at least four receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce signals important in a variety of developmental and physiological processes related to cell growth and differentiation. bFGF and also aFGF glycoprotein membrane receptors of 125-130 kDa and 145-165 kDa are expressed on the cell surfaces of various FGF-sensitive cells at densities of 2x10**5x10**5/cell. The intracellular domains of these receptors encode a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. Binding of the ligand to the receptor leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor protein. </p>
<p>The various receptors for FGF and isoforms arising by alternative splicing are expressed often in a tissue-specific manner. However, a single cell can express more than one isoform. Different specificities are observed with different isoforms. In addition, signaling by these receptors may differ. Cells therefore can display a wide range of responses, depending, among other things, on the relative amounts of different receptor isoforms expressed. </p>
<p>The genes encoding bFGF receptors are members of a gene family, and homologous proteins binding either bFGF, aFGF, or related factors have been isolated also from other species. There is roughly 50-70 % homology between human FGF receptors. The gene known as flg (fms-like gene) encodes a 145 kDa receptor protein. This gene is considered to be a homolog of the corresponding chicken gene (Cek1). The official new nomenclature for flg is FGFR1. </p>
<p>This gene is also related to another gene isolated from humans, mice, and chicken (Cek3), designated bek (125 kDa), a human gene called TK-14, and a gene encoding the receptor for KGF (keratinocyte growth factor). The official nomenclature for this type of bFGF receptor which binds aFGF equally well is FGFR2, and alternative splicing of the FGFR2 gene has been demonstrated to yield the splice variants bek and K-sam. </p>
<p>Yet another type of bFGF receptor, designated FGFR3 (Cek2), also binds aFGF and bFGF equally well. This receptor exists as a membrane-bound form of 125 kDa. </p>
<p>A fourth receptor, mapping at 5q33-qter (see also: 5q minus syndrome) and designated FGFR4 (flg-2), binds aFGF with highest affinity, followed by K-FGF/hst-1 and bFGF. </p>
<p>Differential splicing in the extracellular region of FGFR1 has been shown to generate receptor variants with different ligand-binding specificities. One variant binds bFGF with a 50-fold lower affinity. Truncated forms of FGFR1 have been found as Fibroblast growth factor binding proteins in human and calf plasma. </p>
<p>Binding of bFGF to one of its receptors requires the interaction with heparan sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix before full functional activity is obtained (see also: coreceptor). Syndecan-1 and glypican-1 are known low-affinity receptors for bFGF that present the growth factors to the high-affinity receptor. The involvement of proteoglycans is demonstrated also by the ability of heparinase to inhibit receptor binding and biological activity of bFGF. It has been observed that the membrane-associated factor is phosphorylated by a protein kinase also located on the cell surface, which may additionally alter its activity and bioavailability. Heparin has been shown to protect bFGF from inactivation by proteases, acids, and heat. It also improves its capacity to bind to the receptors and hence potentiates the biological activities of bFGF. This feature may be of physiological importance because mast cells, for example, contain a lot of heparin which could be released during degranulation. In addition, heparin also increases the biological half life of bFGF. </p>
<p>Binding of bFGF (and also of aFGF) to receptor proteins can be inhibited by Suramin, and also by protamine. At least one receptor type has been described to be utilized as a receptor for Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The wide spectrum of biological activities is revealed by the plethora of different names. A multifunctional role of bFGF is suggested by the many different receptor phenotypes expressed in various cell types. bFGF stimulates the growth of fibroblasts, myoblasts, osteoblasts, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, chondrocytes, and many other cell types. In capillary endothelial cells bFGF acts in an autocrine manner. The mitogenic action of bFGF for endothelial cells can be potentiated by thrombin. Transferrin and HDL (high density lipoprotein) also support the activity of bFGF on endothelial cells. </p>
<p>bFGF promotes the maturation and maintenance of cholinergic neurons and acts as a mitogen for chromaffin cells. It also influences the proliferation, differentiation, and function of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. For some cell lines, for example PC12, bFGF is a neurite outgrowth-promoting factor with an activity that is on the same order of magnitude as NGF. For some cholinergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neuronal cells bFGF acts as a differentiation factor promoting outgrowth of neurites and promoting survival. In some cell types this activity is as pronounced as that of CNTF (ciliary neuronotrophic factor). In some cells bFGF appears to induce the expression of certain neuronal-specific genes (for example, SCG-10) the synthesis of which is induced also by NGF. </p>
<p>Rat hippocampal and human cortical neurons have been shown to be protected by bFGF against induced damage induced by iron, which is believed to contribute to the process of cell damage and death resulting from ischemic and traumatic insults (see also: inflammation, wound healing) by catalyzing the oxidation of protein and lipids. bFGF has been shown to allow long-term culture of rat primary hippocampal neurons in serum-free culture media, yielding continuous untransformed cell lines that can be passaged. </p>
<p>Immortalized rat fibroblasts, genetically altered to secrete bFGF into the conditioned medium, have been shown to decrease excitotoxic lesion size by 30 % after implantation in rat brain near the striatum 7 days before striatal infusion of excitotoxic quantities of an NMDA-receptor agonist. </p>
<p>bFGF has been shown to be a promoting or inhibitory modulator of cellular differentiation also for other cell types. bFGF is not only a mitogen for chondrocytes but also inhibits their terminal differentiation. In early embryos bFGF functions as a differentiation factor that induces tissues destined to produce ectodermal structures to differentiate into mesodermal tissues. In cultures of rat retina cells bFGF induces photoreceptor differentiation. The influence of bFGF on differentiation processes are probably the result of a complex interaction with other factors. Elevated levels of bFGF are observed during early embryonic development and it has been suggested that bFGF, in combination with other factors showing similar activities, for example, TGF-beta, may be involved in the development of the mesoderm. </p>
<p>There are many instances in which bFGF retards senescence of cells, thus allowing maintenance of cells in vitro which would normally lose their differentiated phenotype in long-term cultures. </p>
<p>In the pituitary bFGF regulates the secretion of Thyrotropin and Prolactin. bFGF also acts as an ovarian hormone and differentially regulates the expression of steroids. bFGF modulates the proliferation and differentiation of granulosa cells and inhibits induction of receptors for Luteinizing hormone mediated by FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). bFGF also blocks the synthesis of enzymes the expression of which is induced by FSH. bFGF stimulates the synthesis of progesterone. Some of these effects of bFGF are, in turn, blocked by TGF-beta, suggesting that the ratio of bFGF/TGF-beta is used for fine control of these processes. </p>
<p>bFGF also has direct central actions and inhibits food intake in rats after intracerebroventricular injection for at least 12 hours. bFGF has been implicated as an embryonic mesoderm inducing factor and there is also some evidence for an organ- and sex-specific role of FGF in the development of the fetal mammalian reproductive tract. </p>
<p>bFGF (and aFGF) are involved also in angiogenesis by controlling the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells. The expression of plasminogen activator and collagenase activity by these cells is enhanced by bFGF. bFGF is probably one of the factors responsible early in development for the growth of new capillary blood vessels colonizing the mesencephalon and telencephalon which at this time are essentially free of blood vessels. bFGF and/or closely related factors may be engaged also in tumor angiogenesis, facilitating the invasive growth and metastasis of tumors by inducing the synthesis of proteases. Tumors expressing an oncogene encoding factors resembling bFGF constitutively have been shown to support unlimited angiogenesis. </p>
<p>bFGF also plays an important physiological role in tissue regeneration and wound healing. </p>
<p>If bFGF that lacks a normal secretory signal sequence is furnished with a hydrophobic signal sequence the introduction of this recombinant genes into cells leads to malignant transformation and yields cells that are tumorigenic in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies directed against bFGF inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Treatment of these cells with low and nontoxic concentrations (0.5-2.5 microgram/mL) of negatively charged, nonsulfated aromatic compounds (for example, aurin tricarboxylic acid, 4-hydroxyphenoxyacetic acid) result in restoration of their normal proliferative rate, morphological appearance, and adhesion properties. </p>
<p>The synthesis of bFGF by vascular smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts is induced by IL1. In human endothelial cells bFGF reduces the expression of cyclo-oxygenase. The same inhibitory action on bFGF activities is shown also by IFN-gamma which is itself induced by different forms of FGF. In endothelial cells bFGF reduces the expression of the receptor for TGF-beta (see also: Receptor transmodulation), thus effectively modulating the inhibitory action of TGF-beta on endothelial cells. The activity of bFGF (and also of aFGF) on the vascular epithelium is inhibited strongly by TGF-beta. TGF-beta may, however, also have positive actions on bFGF mediated processes in other cell types. </p>
<p>The release of bFGF by astrocytes is enhanced significantly by IL1, IL6 or EGF. Other Lymphokines, and also NGF, have no effect. In microglial cells the release of bFGF is considerably reduced by IL3, EGF and NGF. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>A dominant-negative FGF receptor mutant has been used to block FGF function in suprabasal keratinocytes of transgenic mice. Expression of the mutant receptor, which blocks signal transduction in cells when co-expressed with wild-type receptors, disrupts the organization of epidermal keratinocytes and induces epidermal hyperthickening, showing that FGF is essential for the morphogenesis of suprabasal keratinocytes and for the establishment of the normal differentiation program of keratinocytes. </p>
<p>Treatment of various human tumor cell lines (melanomas, glioblastomas) with antisense RNA directed against bFGF has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of these cells and their ability to form colonies in soft agar (see also: Colony formation assay). </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>bFGF activities can be assayed in a proliferation assay using CCL-39 hamster fibroblasts, human SW-13 cells, 3T3 cells, CRL 1395 cells, bovine FBHE cells, or SR-4987 cells. bFGF can be assayed by a sensitive enzyme immunoassay. bFGF can be detected also by a modification of the Cell blot assay. An alternative and entirely different method of detecting bFGF is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. Golden et al (2000) have described a DNA aptamer directed against human bFGF that is used in the sensitive detection of this growth factor. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>Some preclinical studies have been performed with recombinant bFGF (see also: Recombinant cytokines). It is assumed that bFGF will be of potential interest as a factor promoting wound healing and revascularization of tissues. Animals experiments with bFGF have shown that it promotes endosteal, but not periosteal, bone formation and bFGF may thus be a potential agent for treatment osteoporosis, which may increase bone mass without causing outward deformation of the skeletal bones. </p>
<p>Another possible use of bFGF is suggested by its neurotrophic activities (see also: Neurotrophins). bFGF and also related factors may be useful to support regeneration of tissues after brain, spinal chord, and peripheral nerve injuries (see also: inflammation, wound healing). Animal experiments have shown that the infusion of bFGF positively influences the growth of retinal ganglion cells and also nerve regeneration. Injections of bFGF maintain photoreceptors that would normally degenerate, for example, in cases of inherited retinal dystrophy. bFGF and related factors may play a role also in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. </p>
<p>bFGF is produced in most gliomas and is involved in tumorigenesis and malignant progression, functioning in an autocrine manner. It may play an important role also in tumor neovascularization as a mediator acting in a paracrine manner. Overexpression of bFGF and aFGF in pancreatic cancers has been found to be associated with a more advanced tumor stage. bFGF has been found also to be overexpressed in gastric and renal cell carcinomas. Very high levels of bFGF have been found in the serum and/or urine of patients with many types of cancer. bFGF has been implicated also in the pathology of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas. </p>
<p>Since the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells play a pivotal role in various vascular diseases and since bFGF plays a significant role by acting on endothelial cells in an autocrine manner specific ways to block its expression may have considerable therapeutic implications. By employing antisense RNA specifically blocking the expression of bFGF it has been possible to suppress proliferation of endothelial cells. </p>
<p>bFGF has been shown to improve cardiac systolic function, to reduce infarct size, and to increase the number of arterioles and capillaries in the infarct. Thus, the angiogenic action of bFGF might lead to a reduction in infarct size in a canine experimental myocardial infarct model. </p>
<p>The observation that HSV-1 uses one of the bFGF receptors as an entry port suggests that it may be possible to use specific receptor antagonists to block virus entry, thus preventing later complications of the infection. For further uses of bFGF exploiting the specific interaction of bFGF with its receptor see also: Mitotoxins, Saporin. </p>
<p>Abnormal receptor functions caused by mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 have been found to be responsible for a variety of clinical syndromes associated with craniosynostosis. </p>
