<p>abbr. SCGF (a term with multiple meanings). Note: in some references (not only the older one) the term may apply to SCF [stem cell factor], which is an entirely different factor. </p>
<p>The cDNA for human SCGF encodes a 29 kDa polypeptide (245 amino acids) without N-linked glycosylation (Hiraoka et al, 1997). Human, murine and rat SCGF display approximately 85 % identity at the amino acid level. Don't confuse with SCF, which in the older references may also occur as stem cell growth factor. </p>
<p>Human SCGF-alpha [stem cell growth factor-alpha] is a protein of 323 amino acids (Mio et al, 1998). The shorter form (245 amino acids) is characterized by a deletion within a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain and has been termed SCGF-beta [stem cell growth factor-beta] (Mio et al, 1998). SCGF has been identified as a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. The human gene maps to chromosome 19q13.3 close to the genes encoding flk-2 and IL11. SCGF has been found to be identical with LSLCL [lymphocytic secreted long form of C-type lectin]. The approved gene symbol is CLEC11A [C-type lectin domain family member 11A]. An alternative designation is CLECSF3 [C-type lectin domain superfamily member 3]. </p>
<p>The factor is found in the conditioned medium of the human KPB-M15 myeloid cell line but is not produced by a variety of cell lines established from T-cells or myeloid cells tested (Hiraoka et al, 1987, 1989). Perrin et al (2001) have reported that the factor is concentrated in the cytoplasm of immature neutrophils but not in myeloblasts nor in mature neutrophils. The factor is found also in human placental conditioned medium. Expression of SCGF mRNA appears to be restricted to myeloid cells and fibroblasts. SCGF transcripts are detected in spleen, thymus, appendix, bone marrow and fetal liver. Hiraoka et al (2001) have demonstrated specific expression of SCGF mRNA around skeletal tissues, particularly in bone marrow cells, proliferating chondrocytes, the perichondrium and periosteum, but little expression in resting or hypertrophic chondrocytes. The factor is expressed by normal stromal cells under conditions that promote B-lymphopoiesis (Witte et al, 1993). </p>
<p>SCGF acts as a species-specific growth factor for primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. Hiraoka et al (2001) have reported that recombinant SCGF-alpha alone does not stimulate colony formation, but small cluster-formation from human CD34(+) lineage marker-negative cells cells. It promotes growth of erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colonies in the primary culture with erythropoietin and GM-CSF or G-CSF, respectively, and further supports progenitor cells of granulocytes and macrophages in a short-term liquid culture. SCGF-alpha suppresses erythroid bursts stimulated by SCF. SCGF-alpha synergizes with IL3 and flt-3 ligand to enhance growth of colonies containing granulocyte/macrophage but is not synergistic with those factors inducing ex vivo expansion of granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells (see also: Colony formation assay, BMC). Yuan et al (2006) have reported that the long isoform of SCGF, unlike human SCGF-beta, acts on murine bone marrow CFU-GM progenitor cells and thus does not show strict species specificity. </p>
<p>Gehling et al (2000) have reported that SCGF together with VEGF allows differentiation of endothelial cells from human progenitor cells. </p>
<p>Ito et al (2003) have reported that serum concentrations of SCGF can be used as an indicator of hematopoietic recovery following stem cell transplantation. </p>
