    <h2>TNFSF10</h2>
    
<p>[TNF ligand superfamily member 10] This designation is based on homology with other members of the TNF ligand superfamily of proteins. The protein in question is TRAIL, which is known also as APO-2 ligand or TL2. The murine antigen is Ly81. In the nomenclature of CD antigens this protein has been given the designation CD253. </p>

    <h2>TRAIL</h2>
    
<p>[TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand] The sequence of TRAIL (281 amino acids) was identified in a human heart atrium cDNA library and a murine cDNA library prepared from the 7B9 T-helper cell line. Both cDNAs encode a type 2 membrane protein (N-terminus inside). The gene maps to human chromosome 3q36. TRAIL is called also APO-2 ligand (abbr. APO-2L). The gene encoding this ligand has been described also as TL2 (TNF-like-2) (Tan et al, 1997). Based upon homology with other members of the TNF ligand protein superfamily the protein is referred to also as TNF ligand superfamily member 10 [TNFSF10]. </p>
<p>Membrane bound and soluble forms of TRAIL induce DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in Jurkat and U937 cells and some other lines of hematopoietic origin (see also: hematopoiesis). In humans TRAIL is expressed in a wide spectrum of tissues, including spleen, thymus, prostate, lung, kidney, and intestine. TRAIL-beta and TRAIL-gamma are alternative truncated splice variants of TRAIL that are expressed in neoplastic and normal tissues. TRAIL-beta lacks exon 3 of the TRAIL gene. TRAIL-gamma lacks exons 2 and 3. Both splice variants have lost their pro-apoptotic activity (Krieg et al, 2003). Wang P et al (2011) have identified seven truncated TRAIL variants, (AK, E2, E3, E4, DA, BX424, and BX439). Over-expression of all these TRAIL variants activates NF-kappa-B and its targeting genes in human cells at varying degrees. Some isoforms show NF-kappa-B, IL8, CCL4 and CCL20 promoter activating activity stronger than the wild-type protein. All truncated variant proteins fail to induce apoptosis in cancer cells that are sensitive to TRAIL. Recombinant soluble TRAIL E4 protein also fails to antagonize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. These results suggest that truncated TRAIL variants may play roles in non-apoptotic cellular processes.  </p>
<p>TRAIL appears to represent a marker of differentiation or activation of natural killer cells with phenotypically immature cells mediating TRAIL-dependent but not FAS ligand- or granule release-dependent cytotoxicity, and mature cells mediating the latter two. </p>
<p>The cytotoxic protein induces cell death by apoptosis of many transformed cell lines but not of normal tissues, even though its death domain-containing receptor, DR4, is expressed on both cell types. APO-2 ligand has been shown to activate apoptosis in T-cell enriched cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by IL2, but not in unstimulated cells. </p>
<p>Studies by Kaplan et al (2000) have suggested that TRAIL contributes to macrophage homeostasis by mediating CD4(+) T-cell killing of antigen-presenting macrophages. </p>
<p>Expression of crmA, a virus-derived specific inhibitor of IL1-beta Convertase and of the cysteine protease CPP32, blocks the induction of apoptosis by APO-2 ligand. TRAIL induced apoptosis is blocked also by expression of XIAP or baculovirus p35 protein. Overexpression of BCL2 or BCLxL delay, but do not inhibit, TRAIL induced apoptosis. (Suliman et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Burns and El-Deiry (2001) have demonstrated that overexpression of FLIP-S and BCLxL are sufficient to convey resistance to TRAIL treatment in previously sensitive cancer cell lines. Expression of FLIP-S and BCLxL also protects cells against apoptosis induced by overexpression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. </p>
<p>One ligand for TRAIL has been identified as TRAIL receptor-1, known also as DR4 [death receptor-4] or APO-2. Due to its homology to other members of the TNF receptor superfamily the receptor is being referred to also as TNFRSF10A [TNF receptor superfamily member 10A]. DR4 is a protein of 468 amino acids and is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. The protein is expressed in most human tissues, including spleen, peripheral blood, leukocytes, small intestine, and thymus. DR4 is expressed also in K562 erythroleukemia cells, MCF7 human breast cancer cells and activated T-cells. Overexpression of DR4 triggers apoptosis and this effect can be blocked by expression of crmA, an inhibitor of Caspases. Suliman et al (2001) have shown that FADD and caspase-8, but not caspase-10, are recruited to the DR4 receptor upon ligation with TRAIL. Apoptosis induction by TRAIL is blocked in ells deficient in either FADD or caspase-8 blocked TRAIL induced apoptosis. </p>
<p>TRAIL induces cell death by apoptosis of many transformed cell lines but not of normal tissues, even though its death domain-containing receptor, DR4, is expressed on both cell types. Resistance of some cell types may be explained by the expression of a decoy receptor designated TRID. </p>
<p>Related receptors, all of which interact with TRAIL are TRAIL receptor-2 (TRICK2), TRAIL receptor-3, and TRAIL receptor-4. Another member of the TRAIL receptor family is TRUNDD. </p>
<p>Liabakk et al (2001) have described the generation of monoclonal antibodies against sTRAIL and the development of an ELISA for the soluble form of TRAIL (see also: cytokine assays). </p>
