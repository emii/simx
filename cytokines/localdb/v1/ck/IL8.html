<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL8 is produced by stimulated monocytes but not by tissue macrophages and T-lymphocytes. IL8 is produced also by macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, and a number of tumor cell lines. </p>
<p>In many cell types the synthesis of IL8 is strongly stimulated by IL1 and TNF-alpha. In human skin fibroblasts the expression of IL8 is enhanced by Leukoregulin. The interferon IFN-gamma can function as a costimulator. The synthesis of IL8 is induced also by phytohemagglutinins, concanavalin A, double-stranded RNA, Phorbol esters, sodium urate crystals, viruses, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The expression of IL8 from resting and stimulated human blood monocytes is upregulated by IL7. In chondrocytes the synthesis of IL8 is stimulated by IL1-beta (see: IL1), TNF-alpha and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. In human astrocytes the synthesis and secretion of IL8 is induced by IL1 and TNF-alpha. Glucocorticoids, IL4, TGF-beta, inhibitors of 5' lipoxygenase, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 inhibit the synthesis of IL8. IL8 is constitutively and commonly produced by various carcinoma cell lines and this synthesis may be related to the elevation of serum IL8 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of IL8 is induced by IL17. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL8 is a non-glycosylated protein of 8 kDa (72 amino acids). It is produced by processing of a precursor protein of 99 amino acids. Processing of this precursor by specific proteases yields N-terminal variants of IL8. One of the enzymes converting the 77 amino acid form to the 72 amino acid form has been identified as cathepsin L (see: IL8 converting enzyme). </p>
<p>AVLPR-IL8 is a truncated IL8 variant lacking the first five amino acids. This shortened protein is identical with FDNCF (fibroblast-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor). </p>
<p>Longer forms of IL8 (79 and 77 amino acids) and shorter forms (69 amino acids) have been isolated also from conditioned medium of lymphocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (see: MDNCF, monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factors and FINAP, Fibroblast-derived neutrophil-activating protein), Fibroblasts stimulated by IL1 or TNF (see: NAP-1, neutrophil-activating protein), and polyI: C-stimulated endothelial cells (see: LAI, leukocyte adhesion inhibitor). The predominant form of IL8 produced by endothelial cells (and also by anchorage-dependent cells and human glioblastoma cells) is the 77 amino acid variant. For an endothelial cell-derived IL8 variant ([(Ala)-IL8](77)) serving as an apoptosis inducing factor see also: HL-60 cell line. </p>
<p>The IL8 protein contains four cysteine residues participating in disulfide bridges (Cys-7/Cys-34; Cys-9/Cys-50). </p>
<p>A Leu25Tyr mutation of IL8, which introduces the conserved tyrosine residue present in CC-Chemokines has been shown to create a factor that bestows upon IL8 the property to act as a chemoattractant for monocytes and the ability to bind to the CCR1 chemokine receptor. A Leu25Cys mutation of IL8 introduces chemoattractant activity for monocytes and the ability to displace MIP-1-alpha from the CCR1 receptor. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL8 gene (SCYB8) has a length of 5.1 kb and contains four exons. It maps to human chromosome 4q12-q21. The mRNA consists of a 101 base 5' untranslated region, an open reading frame of 297 bases, and a long 3' untranslated region of 1.2 kb. The 5' flanking region of the IL8 gene contains potential binding sites for several nuclear factors including activation factor-1, activation factor-2, IFN regulatory factor-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, a glucocorticoid responsive element, and a heat shock element. </p>
<p> RELATED FACTORS </p>
<p>The proteins mig (monokine induced by gamma-Interferon) (see also: Monokines), PF4 (platelet factor-4), MGSA (melanoma growth stimulatory activity), and a number of several other factors belonging to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines are related to IL8. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL8 receptor is a dimeric glycoprotein consisting of a 59 kDa and a 67 kDa subunit. It has been given the name CD128. It is expressed in many different cell types including those not responding to IL8. The receptor density is approximately 20000/cell in neutrophils and approximately 300/cell in T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>The IL8 receptor is a member of a G-protein-coupled receptor protein family (see also: GPR9). There are at least two different IL8 receptor types. The type 1 receptor specifically binds IL8 (Kd = 0.8-4 nM). The type 2 receptor (Kd for IL8 = 0.3-2 nM) also binds the IL8-related factors MGSA (Melanoma growth stimulatory activity), GRO (see: MGSA), MIP-2 (see: MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein), and NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2). Both receptor genes map to human chromosome 2q35. For a protein highly homologous to the IL8 receptors see: EBI-1 (EBV induced gene-1) and ECRF-3. The MGSA/GRO/IL8/MIP receptor has been identified as CKR1, which is identical with the Duffy blood group antigen that appears to be a receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. </p>
<p>orf74 encoded by the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus KSHV has been shown to encode a protein with significant sequence homology to the high-affinity IL8 receptor (see also: Viroceptor). IL8 has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The activities of IL8 are not species-specific. Human IL8 is also active in rodent and rabbit cells. The biological activities of IL8 resemble those of a related protein, NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2). </p>
<p>IL8 differs from all other cytokines in its ability to specifically activate neutrophil granulocytes. In neutrophils IL8 causes a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels (see also: Calcium ionophore) and the release of enzymes from granules. IL8 also enhances the metabolism of reactive oxygen species and increases Chemotaxis and the enhanced expression of adhesion molecules. A pre-activation by IL3 is required to render basophils and neutrophils susceptible to further activation by IL8. IL8 alone does not release histamines. IL8 actually inhibits histamine release from human basophils induced by histamine releasing factors (see also: HRF), CTAP-3 (connective tissue activating protein-3), and IL3. IL8 is involved also in mediating pain. </p>
<p>IL8 antagonizes IgE production by human B-cells without induced by IL4, affecting IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, or IgA production. IL8 directly affects B-cells through a specific mechanism that is different from IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, or prostaglandin E2 </p>
<p>The intravenous administration of IL8 in baboons causes a severe, albeit transient, granulocytopenia, followed by a granulocytosis, which persists as long as sufficient IL8 levels are maintained. </p>
<p>IL8 is chemotactic for all known types of migratory immune cells (see also: Chemotaxis). IL8 inhibits the adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells (see also: cell activation) and therefore possesses anti-inflammatory activities (see also: LAI, leukocyte adhesion inhibitor). The 72 amino acid form of IL8 is approximately ten-fold more potent in inhibiting adhesion of neutrophils than the 77 amino acid variant. IL8 is a mitogen for epidermal cells. In vivo IL8 strongly binds to erythrocytes. This absorption may be of physiological importance in the regulation of inflammatory reactions since IL8 bound to erythrocytes no longer activates neutrophils. Macrophage-derived IL8 supports angiogenesis and may play a role in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumor growth, and wound healing that critically depend on angiogenesis. </p>
<p>Binding of IL8 to its receptor and bioactivities of IL8 are inhibited by a synthetic peptide, antileukinate. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Blockade of IL8 expression in some human melanoma cell lines by antisense RNA has shown that IL8 functions as an autocrine growth modulator for these cells. A participation of IL8 in macrophage mediated angiogenesis is suggested by the observation that IL8 antisense RNA blocks angiogenic activity induced by monocytes. </p>
<p>Simonet et al (1994) have studied transgenic mice overexpressing IL8. Elevated serum IL8 levels were found to correlate with increases in circulating neutrophils and decreases in L-selectin expression on the surface of blood neutrophils. Changes in the expression of the integrin-beta-2 integrins Mac-1 (CD11b) and LFA-1 (CD11a) on peripheral blood neutrophilswere not observed. Expression of L-selectin on bone marrow neutrophils and their precursors was normal. The accumulation of neutrophils was observed in the microcirculation of the lung, liver and spleen. Neutrophil extravasation, plasma exudation or tissue damage were absent. Migration of neutrophils into the inflamed peritoneal cavity was severely inhibited. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL8 can be detected in assays measuring the migration of buffy coat leukocytes from agarose blocks. Sensitive immunoassays are also available. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL8 may be of clinical relevance in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated concentrations are observed in psoriatic scales and this may explain the high proliferation rate observed in these cells. IL8 may be also a marker of different inflammatory processes. </p>
<p>IL8 (and also IL1 and IL6) probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic polyarthritis since excessive amounts of this factor are found in synovial fluids. The activation of neutrophils may enhance the migration of cells into the capillaries of the joints. These cells are thought to pass through the capillaries and enter the surrounding tissues thus causing a constant stream of inflammatory cells through the joints. </p>
<p>Human recombinant IL8 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) has been shown that the lesion responsible for defective functions of neutrophils in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome can be restored without stimulating myeloid progenitor cells. IL8 may be able, therefore, to reduce the risks of lethal infections in these patients without the potential risk of stimulating leukemic clones. </p>
