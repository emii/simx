<h1>CXCL9</h1>

    <h2>CXCL9</h2>
    
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL9 has been identified independently as mig [monokine induced by gamma-Interferon] and is known also as CRG-10. An older designation is SCYB9 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 9]. </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL9. </p>
<p> Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL9 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Cole et al (2001) have reported that CXCL9 possesses antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Egesten et al (2007) have reported that CXCL9 possesses antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, which is neutralized by a bacterial virulence factor, SIC. Tonsil fluid from patients with streptococcal pharyngitis contains high amounts of this chemokine. In vitro, inflamed pharyngeal epithelium produce large amounts of CXCL9 in the presence of bacteria. CXCL9 is degraded by speB of Streptococcus pyogenes but, unlike other chemokines, retains its antibacterial activity and thus appears to be a major antibacterial factor in inflammed epithelium (Egesten et al, 2009). </p>
<p>The chemokine is detected also in seminal plasma of fertile donors. Significantly lower levels of CXCL9 are found in in vasectomized donors (Linge et al, 2008). CXCL9 from seminal plasma possesses antibacterial activity against the urogenital pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. </p>

    <h2>mig</h2>
    
<p>[monokine induced by gamma-Interferon] Called also mig-1. Humig = human mig; Mumig = murine mig. </p>
<p>This factor of 14.4 kDa is isolated from murine macrophages (see also: Monokines) (Farber et al, 1990). This protein is called also M119 (name of the corresponding cDNA clone). It is identical with CRG-10 (see: CRG, cytokine responsive gene) and closely related to PF4, MGSA (Melanoma growth stimulatory activity) and IL8. According to a new systematic nomenclature the name CXCL9 has been proposed for this factor. The gene symbol is SCYB9 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 9]. The new designation for this factor is CXCL9. Based on the presence of a conserved three-dimensional motif and direct microbicidal activity, mig has been classified as a kinocidin (microbicidal chemokine). </p>
<p>Human mig has a length of 103 amino acids (11.7 kDa). The protein belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (CXC-Chemokines). The human mig gene has been localized to chromosome 4q21 in the immediate vicinity (less than 16 kb) of the gene encoding IP-10 (Lee and Farber, 1996). </p>
<p>The mig receptor is CXCR3 and this receptor is shared also by two other chemokines, I-TAC and IP-10. </p>
<p>The synthesis of mig is specifically induced in macrophages and in other cells by IFN-gamma, but not by IFN-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Human neutrophils produce mig in response to IFN-gamma in combination with either TNF-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharides and this response is blocked by IL10 and IL4. IFN-gamma, alone or in association with agonists such as fMLP, IL8, G-CSF and GM-CSF have no effect (Gasperini et al, 1999). Cultured mammary epithelial tumor cell lines express mig in response to treatment with IFN-gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Sun et al, 1999). Horton et al (1998) have observed that fragments of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan synergize with IFN-gamma in inducing the expression of mig in mouse macrophages. This effect is not observed with hyaluronan alone. </p>
<p>It is thought that mig is involved in modulating the growth, motility, and activation state of cells participating in inflammatory reactions. </p>
<p>Sauty et al (1999) have shown that IFN-gamma strongly induces expression of IP-10, and the two chemokines mig and I-TAC in activated bronchial epithelium and thus may play a role in pulmonary diseases by recruiting activated T-cells. </p>
<p>mig is a chemoattractant for stimulated but not resting T-cells. but not active on neutrophils or monocytes (Farber et al, 1997; Liao et al, 1995). </p>
<p>Marx et al (2000) have shown that treatment of endothelical cells with activators of a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), significantly inhibits induction of expression by IFN-gamma of mig and the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC. </p>
<p>mig is highly expressed in the papillae of psoriatic lesions and may play an important role as a mediator of T-cell recruitment and activation in psoriasis (Goebeler et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Sgadari et al (1997) have shown that injection of recombinant human mig into Burkitt's tumors growing subcutaneously in nude mice causes tumor necrosis associated with extensive vascular damage. Teruya-Feldstein et al (1997) have reported higher levels of mig and IP-10 gene expression in tissues with necrosis and vascular damage from EBV-positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis and nasal or nasal-type T/natural killer cell lymphomas. </p>
<p>Koga et al (1999) have demonstrated that neutralization of mig activity in mice by suitable antibodies inhibits infiltration of T-cells and macrophages into MHC class 2 disparate murine allografts and acute rejection. Allografts are also not rejected in knock-out mice lacking expression of IFN-gamma while injection of mig directly into the grafts restores T-cell infiltration and rejection. </p>
<p>Romagnani et al (1999) have reported that mig induces proliferation of human mesangial cells. They suggest that this chemokine may act not only as a chemoattractant for infiltrating mononuclear but also directly induce the proliferation of mesangial cells in patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis. </p>
<p>Kunz et al (1999) have found that strong expression of mig is associated with heavy infiltration of T-cells in human malignant melanoma and suggest that mig may be critical for the control of local melanoma tumor growth. Kanegane et al (1998) have suggested that mig and also IP-10 contribute to the antitumor effects of IL12 through their inhibitory effects on tumor vasculature. </p>
<p>Like some other chemokines, mig possesses suppressive activity against immature subsets of myeloid progenitors (see also: hematopoiesis) stimulated to proliferate by multiple growth factors (Broxmeyer et al, 1999). </p>
<p>mig has been shown to possess antiviral activity in vivo (Mahalingam et al, 1999). Liu et al (2001) have shown that the expression of mig is important in the recruitment of T-lymphocytes and host defense following viral infection of the central nervous system. </p>
<p>Muller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including mig. </p>
<p>This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CXCL9.
