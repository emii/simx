<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL3 is produced mainly by T-cells following cell activation by antigens and mitogens, but also by keratinocytes, NK-cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, and monocytes. Some cell lines produce IL3 constitutively. Substances that inhibit the activation of T-lymphocytes such as glucocorticoids or CsA (Cyclosporin A) also inhibit the production of IL3. For the constitutive synthesis of IL3 see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). </p>
<p>IL3 may be associated with the extracellular matrix in the form of complexes with heparan sulfate/proteoglycan. It can thus be stored in a biologically inactive form but it may exert juxtacrine activities also. The molecular mechanisms underlying the release from extracellular matrix stores is still unknown. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>Human IL3 is a protein of 15-17 kDa (133 amino acids). It is synthesized as a precursor containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 19 amino acids. IL3 contains two putative glycosylation sites at positions 15 and 70 and contains a single disulfide bond (Cys16/84). The analysis of bacterial-derived recombinant IL3 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) shows that glycosylation is not required for the activity of IL3. </p>
<p>IL3 sequences are evolutionarily less well conserved. Human and murine IL3 show approximately 29 % homology at the protein level while murine and rat IL3 show approximately 54 % homology. IL3-alpha and IL3-beta are two isoforms of rat IL3. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL3 has a length of approximately 2.2 kb and contains five exons. The gene maps to human chromosome 5q23-31. Murine and human IL3 genes structurally resemble each other but at the nucleotide level the homology is approximately 49 %. The murine IL3 gene maps to chromosome 17. </p>
<p>The human IL3 gene is located in close vicinity to other cytokine genes, including those encoding GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL4 and IL5 The distance between the IL3 and the GM-CSF gene is approximately 9 kb with the IL3 gene on the 5'side of the GM-CSF gene. Deletions of the IL3/GM-CSF locus are observed frequently in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (see also: 5q minus syndrome). </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>IL3 receptors are expressed on macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, basophils, bone marrow progenitor cells, and various myeloid leukemia cells. </p>
<p>IL3/receptor complexes have a Kdis of 10**-9 - 10**-10 M. Binding of IL3 to its receptor causes specific phosphorylation of a 150 kDa membrane glycoprotein. </p>
<p>Biological activities are also detected at the concentration range of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M which suggests the existence either of other high affinity receptor conformations or other receptors. </p>
<p>The high affinity IL3 receptor is formed by aggregation of the IL3-specific subunit of the receptor with another subunit called GM-Rbeta which constitutes the larger subunit of the receptor for GM-CSF and is involved also as a subunit in the formation of IL5 receptors (see also: AIC2A). This subunit which is common to all three receptors is called also Beta c or common beta. In the nomenclature of CD antigens this common protein has been given the designation CD131. See also the Transgenic /Knock-out/Antisense Studies section of this entry for details on mice not expressing the common beta subunit of the receptor complex. </p>
<p>Binding of IL3 to its receptor causes the phosphorylation of the receptor and also of some other cytoplasmic proteins (p70, p56, p38) and also activates protein kinase C in IL3 dependent cell lines (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). The non-receptor tyrosine kinase lyn has been implicated in IL3 mediated signal transduction processes (see also: PTK; protein tyrosine kinase). </p>
<p>For a protein involved in signal transduction see also: CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL3 are species-specific. The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL3 has been described. IL3 is a growth factor that establishes the link between the immune system and the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis). It supports the proliferation and development of almost all types of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: CFU). In rhesus monkeys IL3 causes the expansion of all types of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL3 also supports the differentiation of early non-lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitor cells into colonies of granulocytes, macrophages, erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and mast cells (see also: Colony formation assay). IL3 also stimulates clonal growth of non-hematopoietic stromal cells in bone marrow cultures (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture). IL3 is one of the priming factors for hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and in vivo (see also: cell activation) that makes the cells responsive to later-acting factors such as Epo, GM-CSF and IL6. IL3 also induces the increased expression of receptors for colony stimulating factors (see: CSF). At pico- to nanomolar concentrations IL3 is a chemoattractant for eosinophils and also influences the chemotactic behavior of these cells in response to other chemotactically active factors (see also: Chemotaxis). </p>
<p>IL3 does not appear to be an obligatory factor in normal hematopoiesis. The athymic nude mouse (see also: Immunodeficient mice) which lacks T-cells responsible for IL3 production displays a normal pattern of hematopoietic development. In the lymphoid lineage IL3 supports the growth of preB-cells. </p>
<p>Experiments with an oncogene encoding a tyrosine-specific protein kinase show that the expression of the oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinase abolishes IL3 requirements (and also GM-CSF and IL4 requirements) in factor-dependent cells. The exact mechanism by which these factors regulate proliferation and differentiation is still unknown. </p>
<p>IL3 induces the proliferation of mast cells and macrophages and causes the synthesis of histamines by mast cells and phagocytosis in macrophages. In mast cells IL3 prevents the expression of MHC class 2 molecules normally induced by IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>IL3 induces the expression of complement factor C3a receptors in basophils at nanomolar concentrations. A transient stimulation by IL3 is required to make basophils responsive for further cell activation by IL8 which by itself does not possess histamine releasing activity. Tissue mast cells do not respond to IL3. In macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. IL3 significantly enhances the secretion of other cytokines including IL1, IL6 and TNF. In vitro IL3 also stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes. This observation has been made also in rhesus monkeys treated with recombinant IL3 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) but at present it is unclear whether IL3 is involved in skin reactions associated with the growth of keratinocytes and acanthosis. </p>
<p>IL3 also specifically induces the production of enzymes involved in cellular metabolism, differentiation and DNA/RNA metabolism. Among other things IL3 induces the expression of 20-alpha-steroid dehydrogenase and of histidine and Ornithine decarboxylase. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL3 in astrocytes have been studied in transgenic mice expressing a murine glial fibrillary acidic protein fusion gene. Chiang et al (1996) have shown that chronic CNS production of low levels of IL3 promotes the recruitment, proliferation and activation of microglial cells in white matter regions with consequent primary demyelination and motor disease. These features resemble those found in human inflammatory demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis and HIV leukoencephalopathy. </p>
<p>Robb et al (1995) have created transgenic knock-out mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding the common beta subunit (beta C) of the GM-CSF, IL3, and IL5 receptor complexes. Homozygous deletion mutants exhibit normal development and survive to young adult life. They develop pulmonary peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis. Eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone marrow of homozygous deletion mutants are reduced, while other hematological parameters are normal. Bone marrow cells from homozygous deletion mutants do not show high-affinity binding of GM-CSF, while cells from heterozygous animals show an intermediate number of high-affinity receptors. In clonal cultures of bone marrow cells derived from homozygous deletion mutants, even high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL5 do not stimulate colony formation (see also: Colony formation assay). Differences in the systemic clearance and distribution of GM-CSF between mutant and wild-type littermates are not observed. </p>
<p>Nishinakamura et al (1996) have crossed beta-c mutant mice with mice deficient for IL3. The double-mutant mice lacking all IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 functions are apparently normal and fertile. The animals show the same reduced numbers of eosinophils and a lack of eosinophilic response to parasites as beta-c mutant mice. The immune response of the double mutant mice to Listeria mono-cytogenes is normal. Hematopoietic recovery after treatment with Fluorouracil is also normal. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanism to produce blood cells that do not depend on the presence of IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL3 can be detected in bioassays employing responsive cell lines (see: AML-193; 32D; B6SUt-A; B13; Da; Ea3.17; FDCP1; GF-D8; IC-2; KMT-2; L138.8A; LyD9; MO7E; NFS-60; PT-18; TALL-103; TF-1; TMD2; UT-7). A sensitive ELISA test for IL3 is also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL3 alone or in combination with other colony stimulating factors (see also: CSF) or Epo is probably useful in the reconstitution of bone marrow and in stimulating erythropoiesis (see also: hematopoiesis). IL3 also appears a valuable substance in view of its ability to stimulate the proliferation of very immature hematopoietic progenitor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM, which can be enhanced even more by simultaneous administration of other factors such as GM-CSF. These effects can be exploited in the generation of stem cells, allowing stem cell separation and re-infusion into patients undergoing, for example, intensive chemotherapy. It may be useful also in the treatment of anemic patients with congenital defects such as BFU-E deficiency. IL3 appears to be of limited benefit in patients who are severely aplastic after autologous bone marrow transplantation and have very low levels of bone marrow progenitors. </p>
<p>In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, who frequently present with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia due to defective maturation of bone marrow cells initial phase I/II trials with IL3 have demonstrated an increase in the counts of neutrophils in 59 %, of counts of platelets in 34 %, and in counts of reticulocytes in 25 % of the patients. </p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that IL3 administered subcutaneously appears to be an interesting hematopoietic growth factor (see also: Hematopoietins) for reduction of chemotherapy induced myelotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. </p>
<p>IL3 is probably of major importance in the treatment of thrombopenias, secondary hematopoietic insufficiencies and certain types of refractory anemia. The administration of IL3 followed by subsequent course of IL6 greatly improves platelet counts. This combination, therefore, may allow an effective control of thrombocytopenias and severe bleeding frequently associated with this condition. </p>
<p>Some monocytic and myeloid leukemias the growth of which is inhibited almost completely by antibodies directed against IL3 have been described in the mouse These leukemias are characterized by the overexpression of the IL3 gene. In humans, however, such cases have not been described to date. A number of malignant myeloid and lymphoid leukemias respond to IL3. In vitro ALL blast cells can be made more responsive to cytotoxic drugs such as cytosine arabinoside by treatment with IL3. At present it is unclear whether this also occurs in vivo. </p>
