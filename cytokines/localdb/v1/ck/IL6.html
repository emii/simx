<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL6 is produced by many different cell types. The main sources in vivo are stimulated monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Macrophages, T-cells and B-lymphocytes, granulocytes, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, mast cells, glial cells, and keratinocytes also produce IL6 after stimulation. Glioblastoma cells constitutively produce IL6 and the factor can be detected also in the cerebrospinal fluid. Human milk also contains IL6 (see: MGF, milk growth factor). </p>
<p>Cardiac myxomas and cervical and bladder carcinomas secrete large amounts of IL6 into the conditioned medium. Very high levels of IL6 are also detected in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but not with osteoarthritis. </p>
<p>Physiological stimuli for the synthesis of IL6 are IL1, bacterial endotoxins, TNF, PDGF, and Oncostatin M. In fibroblasts the synthesis of IL6 is stimulated by IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, PDGF, and viral infections. In thymic stromal cells the synthesis of IL6 can be induced by NGF. IL6 can also stimulate or inhibits its own synthesis, depending upon the cell type. For the constitutive production of IL6 see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of IL6 is induced by IL17. </p>
<p>IL6 is produced also in the anterior lobe of the pituitary and can be induced by bacterial endotoxins and all substances elevating intracellular levels of cAMP (prostaglandin E2, forskolin, cholera toxin). VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) also stimulates the synthesis of IL6 in the anterior lobe of the pituitary while Growth hormone releasing hormone is inactive. Macrolide antibiotics spiramycin and erythromycin stimulate the synthesis of IL6 in human monocytes following cell activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharides but not the synthesis of IL1 or TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>Glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of IL6 and IL4 or TGF-beta reduce its synthesis. The synthesis of IL6 by human alveolar macrophages is inhibited by IL4. </p>
<p>In serum IL6 is complexed with Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Alpha2M) which protects IL6 from cleavage by proteases and possibly functions as a transport protein. </p>
<p>The release of IL6 from isolated rat macrophages in culture is stimulated by Histogranin. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL6 is a protein of 185 amino acids glycosylated at positions 73 and 172. It is synthesized as a precursor protein of 212 amino acids. Monocytes express at least five different molecular forms of IL6 with molecular masses of 21.5-28 kDa. They mainly differ by post-translational alterations such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. </p>
<p>IL6 isolated from various cell types shows some microheterogeneity in its N-terminus. A 42-45 kDa form has been observed in plasma that is probably complexed with a carrier protein Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Alpha2M) Murine and human IL6 show 65 % sequence homology at the DNA level and 42 % homology at the protein level. For a truncated form of IL6 with antagonist activities see: tIL6. </p>
<p>IL6 is a member of a family of cytokines, which also includes LIF, CNTF, Oncostatin M, IL11, and CT-1. All known members of the IL6 cytokine family induce hepatic expression of acute phase proteins. </p>
<p>IL6-Delta-4 is an isoform constituting a splice variant of IL6 that lacks exon 4. The protein lacks two amino acids necessary for IL6 homodimerization and two of six amino acids required for interaction with IL6 receptor-beta. This isoform forms a stable complex with IL6 receptor-alpha. IL6-Delta-4 may compete with native IL6 for binding to the IL6 receptor-alpha and regulate IL6 bioactivities because of its inability to transmit IL6 receptor-beta-mediated signaling (Bihl et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Fischer et al (1997) have described the construction of a stable and highly bioactive designer cytokine (see also: Muteins) consisting of a fusion protein between IL6 and a soluble IL6 receptor. This hybrid, designated H-IL6 (Hyper-IL6), has been used for the expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells) and is useful in cases in which cells do not respond to IL6 but require a stable complex consisting of IL6 and a soluble IL6 receptor. </p>
<p>For a human recombinant fusion protein consisting of IL6 and IL2 see: CH925. For a virus-encoded homolog of IL6 see: viral IL6. </p>
<p>For a series of artificial cytokines derived from sequences of human IL6 and GCSF (termed Harlequin molecules) see: Muteins. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL6 gene has a length of approximately 5 kb and contains five exons. It maps to human chromosome 7p21-p14 between the markers D7S135 and D7S370. The murine gene maps to chromosome 5. The nucleotide sequences of IL6 and G-CSF genes resemble each other in a way suggesting a possible evolutionary relationship. </p>
<p>The IL6 gene promoter contains many different regulatory elements allowing the induction of expression by various stimuli, including glucocorticoids and cAMP (see also: gene expression). The NF-kappa-B binding site is responsible in non-lymphoid cells for the induction of the IL6 gene expression by IL1 or TNF. In lymphoid cells a factor related to the rel oncogene (IL6kB binding factor II) functions as a repressor that prevents the interaction of transcription factors with the IL6-kappa-B binding site. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL6 receptor is expressed on T-cells, mitogen-activated B-cells, peripheral monocytes and some macrophage- and B-cell derived tumor cell types. It is not expressed in resting B-cells but in resting T-cells. In hepatocytes the IL6 receptor expression is enhanced after treatment with IL6 or IL1. In several cell types the expression of the IL6 receptor is also enhanced by glucocorticoids. For the over-expression of the IL6 receptor see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). The IL6 receptor gene maps to human chromosome 1q21. </p>
<p>The IL6 receptor is a strongly glycosylated protein of 80 kDa and a length of 449 amino acids. It has been designated CD126. It is synthesized as a precursor of 468 amino acids. The molecular structure resembles that of receptors for M-CSF, PDGF and IL1 in that the receptor contains an immunoglobulin-like sequence domain in the aminoterminal region of the extracellular receptor domain. </p>
<p>The intracellular domain of the IL6 receptor has a length of approximately 82 amino acids and does not show any homology to other proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. </p>
<p>Two different forms of the receptor have been described that bind IL6 with different affinities (Kdis = 10**-9 and 10**-11 M) and most likely arise by post-translational modification of the same receptor protein. </p>
<p>Biological activities of IL6 have been found also at concentrations of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M suggesting either the existence of other high-affinity receptor conformations or the existence of further receptor molecules with higher affinities. </p>
<p>IL6 receptor mediated signal transduction involves protein kinase C and also adenylate cyclase. </p>
<p>The complex formed between IL6 and its receptor associates with a transmembrane glycoprotein, gp130 (918 amino acids; cytoplasmic domain of 277 amino acids), that is involved in signal transduction. Binding of IL6 to its receptor leads to disulfide-linked homodimerization of gp130 and the associated activation of a tyrosine kinase as the first step of signal transduction. gp130 is expressed also in cells that do not express IL6 receptors. It has been found to be a component of other receptors, including those for IL11, LIF, Oncostatin M, and CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor), and CT-1. This explains why LIF, CNTF and IL6 share many biological activities although the factors themselves are not related to each other. A factor resembling STAT proteins, termed LIL factor, has been found to be involved in signaling pathways of IL6, and also of IL1 and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p>A soluble form of the IL6 receptor (see: IL6R-SUP; IL6 receptor soluble urinary protein) has been described also that also interacts with gp130. These soluble receptors probably function as physiological regulators of cytokine activities (see also: Cytokine inhibitors) by inhibiting receptor binding or act as transport proteins. Similar soluble receptors or binding proteins have been described also for IL1 (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), IL2, IL4, IL7, TNF-alpha, IGF, and IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Some cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells and neuronal cells, are only responsive towards a combination of IL6 and soluble IL6 receptor but not to IL6 alone. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL6 is biologically active in monkeys, rats, and mice. Murine IL6 is not active in human cells. </p>
<p>The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL6 has been described. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine influencing antigen-specific immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It is one of the major physiological mediators of acute phase reaction. </p>
<p>In hepatocytes IL6 in combination with glucocorticoids induces the synthesis of metallothioneins and increases intracellular zinc levels, thus preventing CCL4 induced hepatotoxicity. </p>
<p>IL6 is a that promotes survival of cholinergic neurons in culture (see also: neurotrophic factors). Some neuronal cell lines can be induced to differentiate by IL6. For other neurotrophic factors see also: Neurotrophins. </p>
<p>IL6, like IL1, stimulates the synthesis of ACTH (Corticotropin) in the pituitary. Glucocorticoids synthesized in response to ACTH inhibit the production of IL6, IL1 and TNF in vivo, thus establishing a sort of negative feedback loop between the immune system and neuroendocrine functions. In astrocytes IL6 induces the synthesis of NGF. </p>
<p>IL6 is a B-cell differentiation factor in vivo and in vitro (see also: BCDF) and an activation factor for T-cells (see also: cell activation). In the presence of IL2 IL6 induces the differentiation of mature and immature T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells. IL6 also induces the proliferation of thymocytes and probably plays a role in the development of thymic T-cells. </p>
<p>IL6 is capable of inducing the final maturation of B-cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells if the cells have been pre-activated by IL4. In B-cells IL6 stimulates the secretion of antibodies to such a degree that serum IgG1 levels can rise 120-400-fold. </p>
<p>IL6 at concentrations of only 0.002 ng/mL is one of the major autocrine growth modulator for many human myelomas. The growth of these cells can be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against IL6. It can be inhibited also by the introduction of antisense RNA against IL6 or by IL4. The growth-inhibitory effects of corticosteroids on myeloma cells is probably due to the steroid induced reduction in the expression of IL5. The growth of human IL6 dependent myeloma cells (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) can be inhibited also by IFN-gamma. IL6 may function also as an autocrine growth modulator for other tumor types, some of which have been found to secrete IL6 constitutively. IL6 has been shown to be an autocrine modulator of growth for in vitro cervical tumor cell growth. On the other hand IL6 blocks the growth of some solid tumors such as mammary carcinomas, cervical carcinomas, human lung cancer cell lines, histiocytic lymphomas, and melanomas. The growth-inhibitory effects are probably compensated by an IL6 induced reduction in cell-to-cell interactions, which also promotes increased metastasizing potential. </p>
<p>IL6 has been found to be expressed in murine blastocysts before hematopoietic differentiation hematopoietic growth factor. This suggests that IL6 also regulates the growth and development of trophoblasts or embryonic stem cells. </p>
<p>IL6 and IL3 synergise in vitro in promoting the proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL6 is also a thrombopoietin that induces the maturation of megakaryocytes in vitro and increases platelet counts in vivo. In murine, but not in human bone marrow cultures (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture) IL6 shows activities resembling those of GM-CSF. </p>
<p>Plasmacytoma cells produce IL6 and also the IL6 receptor. It has been suggested that these cells are stimulated in an autocrine fashion. A paracrine mechanism involving the presence of two different cell populations, one producing the factor and the other expressing the receptor, has been described also. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL6 have been evaluated in transgenic mice expressing the human IL6 gene. These animals display dramatically elevated serum levels of IL6 and polyclonal IgG1. In addition one observes a massive plasmacytosis and all typical indications of a proliferative mesangial glomerulonephritis, which is probably due to the excessive overproduction of the cytokine. </p>
<p>Transgenic mice expressing the IL6 gene under the control of the human keratin gene promoter express IL6 in squamous epithelial cells. These mice are much smaller than normal mice and they also show a retarded development of the coat. An increased proliferation of epidermal cells and an infiltration of leukocytes are not observed. Other transgenic mice constitutively expressing murine IL6 at a level sufficient to induce IL6-responsive genes show less immature B-cells in bone marrow and expression of IL6-inducible liver genes, but the mice appear healthy and can easily be used for breeding. A high incidence of lymphomas associated with different tissues is observed only in mice older than 18 months. </p>
<p>Intracerebral overexpression of IL6 in transgenic mice has been shown to be associated with neurological syndromes the severity of which correlate with the levels of IL6 expression. These mice are characterized by runting, tremor, neurodegeneration, astrocytosis, angiogenesis, and induction of acute phase proteins production, suggesting a direct pathogenic role of IL6 in inflammatory, infectious, and neurodegenerative CNS diseases. </p>
<p>Brett et al (1995) have used a transgenic mouse model to express IL6 in brain astrocytes. They demonstrate an extensive break down of the blood brain barrier. Depending upon expression levels and age the animals show a leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrate, vacuolated astrocytic foot processes and endothelial abnormalities, parenchymal inflammation, gliosis, spongiform change, axonal degeneration and macrophage accumulation. </p>
<p>Kitamura et al (1995) have produced transgenic mice expressing human IL6. The animals showed histologically evident neutrophilia in the bone marrow. A Colony formation assay of bone marrow cells for CFU-C revealed increases in precursors of granulocytes and monocytes (see also: hematopoiesis). A decrease in osteoblast precursor cells was observed in 15 week old mice. Osteoclast numbers and bone resorption were also decreased. </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL6 have been studied also in IL6 deficient mice generated by targeted disruption of the IL6 gene in embryonic stem cells (see: ES cells). IL6 deficient mice of both sexes are viable and fertile and do not present any evident phenotypic abnormality. However, analysis of bone metabolism in females demonstrates that these animals have higher rates of bone turnover than control litter mates. In these mice, ovariectomy, which is known to result in increased bone turnover with bone resorption exceeding bone formation in normal animals, does not induce any change in either bone mass or bone remodeling rates. These results suggest that IL6 plays an important role in the local regulation of bone turnover and appears to be essential for bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an IL6 gene disruption have been studied in mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IL6 gene develop normally. The development of bone marrow and spleen B-cells in IL6 deficient mice appears to be normal. Numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T-cells are consistently reduced by 20-40 % as compared to controls, suggesting that IL6 is involved in T-cell proliferation. Thymocytes and T-cells show a normal expression pattern of T-cell receptor alpha, beta, gamma, and delta chains, CD4, CD8, and some other markers. </p>
<p>IL6 deficient mice fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The T-cell dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. IL6 deficient mice also show gross abnormalities with respect to the acute phase reaction in response to tissue damage or infection (see also: inflammation, wound healing). This response, however, is only moderately affected after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL6 can be detected in bioassays employing IL6 responsive cell lines (see: 7TD1; B9; CESS, KPMM2, KT-3; M1, MH60-BSF-2, MO7E; Mono Mac 6; NFS-60; PIL-6; SKW6-Cl4; T1165; XG-1). IL6 can be assayed also by its activity as a hybridoma growth factor (see: HGF). </p>
<p>Sensitive immunoassays and colorimetric tests are also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. An ELISA assay exists for detecting the receptor-associated gp130 protein. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The determination of IL6 serum levels may be useful to monitor the activity of myelomas and to calculate tumor cell masses. Low IL6 serum levels are observed in monoclonal gammopathies and in smouldering myelomas while IL6 serum levels are markedly increased in patients with progressive disease and also in patients with plasma cell leukemia. A blockade of the IL6 receptor or the inhibition of IL6 by monoclonal antibodies may be a way to delay or prevent the maturation of B-cells into plasma cells, suggesting also a new therapeutical concept involving cytostatic drugs coupled to monoclonal antibodies. </p>
<p>The deregulated expression of IL6 is probably one of the major factor involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. The excessive overproduction of IL6 (and other B-cell differentiation factors; see also: BCDF) has been observed in various pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, Lennert syndrome (histiocytic lymphoma), Castleman's disease (lymphadenopathy with massive infiltration of plasma cells, hyper gamma-globulinemia, anemia, and enhanced concentrations of acute phase proteins), cardiac myxomas and liver cirrhosis. The constitutive synthesis of IL6 by glioblastomas and the secretion of IL6 into the cerebrospinal fluid may explain the elevated levels of acute phase proteins and immune complexes in the serum. </p>
<p>IL6 probably also plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic polyarthritis (together with IL1 and IL8) since excessive concentrations of IL6 are found in the synovial fluid. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that IL6, due to its effects on hematopoietic cells, may be suitable for the treatment of certain types of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Pretreatment with IL3 and subsequent administration of IL6 has been shown to increase platelet counts considerable. A combination of these two factors could therefore be valuable for the effective control of thromocytopenias and the very severe complications (excessive bleeding) usually associated with this condition. In combination with other cytokines (for example, IL2) IL6 may be useful in the treatment of some tumor types. </p>
<p>Very high levels of IL6 in the cerebrospinal fluid are observed frequently in bacterial (up to 500 ng/mL) and viral meningitis (10 - 1000 ng/mL). The detection of elevated concentrations of IL6 in the urine of transplanted patients may be an early indicator of a graft-versus-host reaction. The detection of IL6 in the amniotic fluid may be an indication of intra-amniotic infections. In inflammatory intestinal diseases elevated plasma levels of IL6 may be an indicator of disease status. In patients with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis elevated urine levels of IL6 are also an indicator of disease status. </p>
<p>Monitoring of postoperative serum IL6 levels may be more helpful than monitoring of C-reactive protein levels for estimation of inflammatory status and early detection of an acute phase reaction. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL6 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts. Altered tumor cells expressing IL4 also increase systemic immunity. Mice vaccinated with transduced cells reject a subsequent challenge of non-transduced cells, and, in some cases, a pre-existing tumor (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>Serum and urinary IL6 levels have been shown to be predicting factors of Kawasaki disease activity. </p>
