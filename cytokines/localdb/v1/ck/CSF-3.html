<h1>CSF-3</h1>

    <h2>CSF-3</h2>
    
<p>[Colony stimulating factor-3] This factor was described initially as an activity promoting the development of colonies containing granulocytes in a colony formation assay (see also: CSF for general information about colony stimulating factors). </p>
<p>The factor is isolated from cultured murine lung, human T-cell lines, human Hodgkin tumor cell lines, and human fibrous histiocytoma cell lines (Burgess et al, 1977, 1985, 1986; Byrne et al, 1986; Erickson-Miller, 1988). The factor is identical with G-CSF and the designation CSF-3 has been proposed by Pimentel (1990) following the number-based nomenclature for M-CSF (CSF-1) and GM-CSF (CSF-2). </p>

<p>A recombinant mutated form of human G-CSF is KW-2228 (= Marograstim) (see also: Recombinant cytokines). Recombinant G-CSF is also marketed under the generic name Filgrastim and Lenograstim and under the brand names Neupogen, Neutrogin, and Granocyte. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>G-CSF was isolated initially as a factor supporting the growth of colonies of granulocytes in soft agar cultures (see also: CSF and Colony formation assay). </p>
<p>The factor is secreted by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils after cell activation. It is produced also by stromal cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Epithelial carcinomas, acute myeloid leukemia cells and various tumor cell lines (bladder carcinomas, medulloblastomas), also express this factor. </p>
<p>The synthesis of G-CSF can be induced by bacterial endotoxins, TNF, IL1 and GM-CSF. Prostaglandin E2 inhibits the synthesis of G-CSF. In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of G-CSF is induced by IL17. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>G-CSF is an O-glycosylated 19.6 kDa glycoprotein with a pI of 5.5. The biologically active form is a monomer. The analysis of its cDNA has revealed a protein of 207 amino acids containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 30 amino acids. G-CSF contains 5 cysteine residues, four of which form disulfide bonds (positions 36-42; 64-74). The sugar moiety of G-CSF is not required for full biological activity. </p>
<p>Comparison of the primary sequence of G-CSF with those of the two other colony stimulating factors, GM-CSF and M-CSF, shows that the three factors are not related to each other. Murine and human G-CSF show a sequence homology of approximately 70 % at the DNA level and of 72 % at the protein level. </p>
<p>For a series of artificial cytokines derived from sequences of human IL6 and GCSF (termed Harlequin molecules) see: Muteins. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene has a length of 2.5 kb and includes five exons. The human G-CSF gene maps to chromosome 17q21-q22. It is located in the vicinity of a translocation break point which frequently occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemias. </p>
<p>The nucleotide sequences of G-CSF and IL6 reveal similarities, which suggest that both genes are evolutionary related. </p>
<p>Differential splicing of the G-CSF mRNA can lead to the production of two variant forms of this protein. One of the resulting proteins is shortened by 3 amino acids. </p>
<p>The 5'region of the G-CSF gene contains several sequence domains called CLE (conserved lymphokine element). They are binding sites for transcription factors (see also: gene expression). One binding site, designated CK-1 (see: Cytokine 1) binds a transcription factor that mediates enhanced transcription of the G-CSF gene, inducible by several other cytokines. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The G-CSF receptor (new disgnation: CD114; see also: CD antigens) is expressed on all cells of the neutrophils and granulocytes lineage. It is expressed also in placenta cells, endothelial cells and various carcinoma cell lines. </p>
<p>The human receptor has a length of 813 amino acids. It displays the classical elements of many other cytokine receptors, i.e., an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The human receptor shows 62.5 % sequence homology to the murine receptor. The receptor binds G-CSF with high affinity (Kdis = 550 picoM). The gene encoding the human G-CSF receptor (CSF-3R) maps to chromosome 1p32-p34. 3. </p>
<p>At least four different forms of the human G-CSF receptor, resulting from alternative splicing of the mRNA, have been cloned from human placenta and U937 myeloid leukemia cells. One variant contains a deletion of the transmembrane region and is probably a soluble form of the receptor. Another variant contains 27 additional amino acids in its cytoplasmic domain. This form has been described to be expressed in placenta. </p>
<p>Severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) is characterized by profound absolute neutropenia and a maturation arrest of marrow progenitor cells at the stage of promyelocytes and myelocytes (see also: hematopoiesis). It has been shown that a somatic point mutation in one allele of the G-CSF receptor gene in a patient with severe congenital neutropenia results in a cytoplasmic truncation of the receptor. The mutant receptor chain still transduces a strong growth signal but this signal is unable to trigger maturation. The mutant receptor chain probably acts in a dominant negative manner to block granulocytic maturation. </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human G-CSF is active in murine cells and vice versa. G-CSF stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells committed to the neutrophils and granulocytes lineage in a dose-dependent manner (see also: hematopoiesis). At higher concentrations this factor induces the generation of colonies in soft agar cultures (see also: Colony formation assay) containing granulocytes and macrophages. The fully differentiated neutrophilic granulocytes are functionally activated by G-CSF (see also: cell activation). G-CSF is a mitogen for some human myeloid leukemia cells and also for some carcinoma cell lines. </p>
<p>G-CSF synergises with some other cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL4. GM-CSF and G-CSF are required, for example, to develop neutrophilic colonies in vitro. The concerted action of G-CSF and Epo is required to support the growth of mixed colonies of the early erythroid progenitors. A combination of IL4 with G-CSF has been shown to lead to synergistic suppression of the growth of some human leukemic cell lines. </p>
<p>In vitro G-CSF enhances the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of granulocytes against tumor cells. G-CSF induces the synthesis of receptors for fMLP (Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) which, in turn, induces the prolonged production of oxygen radicals and the release of arachidonic acid. G-CSF also increases the synthesis of Fc-receptors for IgA. Unlike GM-CSF, G-CSF does not induce the expression of cellular markers such as CD11A and CD11C. </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>G-CSF can be assayed in Colony formation assay employing murine bone marrow cells. Stimulation of proliferation of bone marrow cells induced by G-CSF is used also to assay this factor. G-CSF is also detected in specific bioassays with cells lines that depend in their growth on the presence of G-CSF or that respond to this factor (see: AML-193; 32D; BaF3; GNFS-60; HL-60, M1; NFS-60; OCI/AML1a; WEHI-3B). </p>
<p>An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The main and most important clinical application of G-CSF is probably the treatment of transient phases of leukopenia following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. G-CSF can be used to expand the myeloid cell lineage. It has been shown that the pretreatment with recombinant human G-CSF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) prior to marrow harvest can improve the graft by increasing the total number of myeloid lineage restricted progenitor cells, resulting in stable but not accelerated myeloid engraftment of autologous marrow. </p>
<p>Animal experiments and also the administration in humans have shown that the continuous administration of G-CSF for several days increases peripheral blood counts of neutrophils by a factor of 10-15-fold without having any effects on erythrocytes and platelets. The daily administration is required to maintain elevated levels of neutrophils. The duration of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and neutropenia following autologous bone marrow transplantation is also markedly decreased by treatment with G-CSF. </p>
<p>Marked improvements of hematological parameters have been observed also in the treatment of patients with congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome), patients with neutropenia caused by diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and in cases of chronic idiopathic neutropenia. One general effect of treatment with G-CSF appears to be a marked reduction of severe infections and episodes of fever which are normally observed to occur in these patients. G-CSF treatment also allows dose intensification with various antitumor drug regimes. The dosage of antibiotics can be reduced also. </p>
<p>It appears that the subcutaneous administration of G-CSF is more favorable at low doses than intravenous injection. Some animal experiments suggest that the effects of lethal irradiation can be abolished by a timely administration of G-CSF and that the complete reconstitution of hematopoiesis is possible. At present data from human irradiated patients are not yet available. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional G-CSF gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
