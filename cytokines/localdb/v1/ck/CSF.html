<h1>CSF</h1>

    <h2>CSF</h2>
    
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) cell scattering factors. See: Motogenic cytokines. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) colony stimulating factors </p>
<p>colony stimulating activities, also abbr. CSA. </p>
<p>This term goes back to experiments carried out in the 60ies, which attempted to grow colonies of bone marrow cells immobilized in soft agar or methyl cellulose (see also: Colony formation assay). It was found that Feeder cell layers and also the supplementation of the growth media with conditioned medium considerably promoted colony growth, suggesting the existence of colony stimulating factors secreted by the cells. </p>
<p>While hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis) could be maintained only for short periods of time in the absence of such factors, their presence allowed the development of colonies containing erythroid cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and megakaryocytes (see also: CFU, colony-forming unit). The biochemical analysis of various activities stimulating colony formation supporting the growth and development of these cell types revealed that there existed many different and distinct factors of this sort. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors belong to the group of regulatory proteins and peptides known as cytokines. Many of these factors are either N- or O-glycosylated. Glycosylation has been shown to enhance the solubility, stability and resistance to proteolytic enzymes. It does not appear to be required for the full spectrum of biological activities of these factors (see also: Recombinant cytokines). The genes encoding many of the human colony stimulating factors have been cloned and mapped. Some of the genes are in close vicinity but they do not show great homology among each other with the exception of some conserved regions. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors are produced by many different cell types, including, for example, B-lymphocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, bonemarrow stromal cells, T-lymphocytes. They are synthesized as precursor molecules containing a classical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of approximately 25-32 amino acids (see also: gene expression). </p>
<p>The secreted factors have an extremely high specific biological activity (10**8 - 10**9 units/mg protein) and are, therefore, active at very low concentrations (1-100 pM). These factors are absolutely required for the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The concentrations required for mere maintenance of viability are usually orders of magnitude lower than those required to induce cell proliferation or to elicit specific functional activities of the cells. </p>
<p>The names of the individual factors usually indicate the cell types that respond to these factors. The classical colony stimulating factors include M-CSF (specific for macrophages), G-CSF (specific for granulocytes), GM-CSF (specific for macrophages and granulocytes), IL3 (multifunctional) and MEG-CSA (specific for megakaryocytes). G-CSF and M-CSF are lineage-specific while GM-CSF and IL3 are multifunctional hematopoietic growth factors acting on earlier stages of differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Some of the biological activities of colony stimulating factors are concentration-dependent, i.e., biological activities may differ depending upon whether low or high concentrations of the corresponding factors act on the cells. In addition, the activities of many of these factors can be synergised and antagnoized by other factors. </p>
<p>Factors such as Epo, which is involved in erythropoiesis, but also most of the factors known as Interleukins, are not classified as colony stimulating factors. In combination with colony-forming factors they constitute the group of so-called hematopoietins (hematopoietic growth factors). </p>
<p>The synthesis of colony stimulating factors can be stimulated by immunological reactions and products of infectious agents. In some cell types their synthesis can be stimulated by a factor of up to 1000. The induction of synthesis may be direct or a consequence of the activity of other hematopoietic factors. The synthesis of IL1, for example, is induced by bacterial endotoxins or foreign antigens, and IL1, in turn, is capable of stimulating the synthesis of various colony stimulating factors. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors may act as differentiation factors initiating the irreversible terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Colony stimulating factors also induce the synthesis of many other growth factors and play an important role in the maintenance of membrane integrity and cell viability. The proliferation of mature cells is usually not influenced by these factors, they may, however, prolong their life span. Apart from their actions on a number of hematopoietic cell types colony stimulating factors also influence other cell types. </p>
<p>The stimulation of hematopoietic cells in particular by colony stimulating factors is the basis of their clinical use in patients suffering from diverse forms of hematopoietic disorders. The use of molecular biological techniques, culminating in the cloning and expression of the genes encoding the colony stimulating factors has been instrumental in this development. Most of these factors are now available in highly purified form and in sufficient amounts allowing an assessment of their therapeutical efficacy and their use in the clinic (see also: Recombinant cytokines. </p>
<p>The use of these mediators opens ways of reconstituting aberrant hematopoietic processes in a physiological manner. This includes more or less all varieties of disorders, which are characterized either by an insufficient maturation of blood cells or by a reduced production of leukocytes. The fact that different cell types vary in their responses to individual colony stimulating factors can be used to expand differentially defined populations of progenitor cells. On the one hand, these factors can be used to correct chemotherapy induced cytopenias. Colony stimulating factors can be used to counteract cytopenia-related predisposition to infections and hemorrhages. Since these factors are capable also of influencing the growth cycle of many malignant cell types, many of them showing at least tumoricidal activities, colony stimulating factors may be used also in the directed treatment of various cancers either alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs. </p>
<p>The major advantage of treatments involving the use of colony stimulating factors is certainly the more or less physiological reconstitution of hematopoietic processes. So far there are no indications that treatments with these factors lead to an exhaustion of the normal stem cell population in the bone marrow or to the proliferation on non-myeloid tumors (see also: hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p>A novel concept is the so-called peripheral stem cell separation. This technique involves the expansion of peripheral stem cells by in vivo pretreatment with suitable colony stimulating factors and their subsequent collection. These cells can be re-infused at a later time to normalize blood parameters, following, for example, extensive courses of drug treatment. </p>
<p>Available colony stimulating factors can be used in different clinical stettings and the entire spectrum of clinical indications is only just now emerging. </p>
