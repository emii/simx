    <h2>IL1ra</h2>
    
<p> </p>
<p>[IL1 receptor antagonist] The gene symbol IL1RN is used instead of IL1RA, which is used for the gene encoding one of the two forms of IL1 receptor. This factor has been called also IL1 inhibitor, IRAP (IL1 receptor antagonist protein), IL1 inhibitory activity, ILS. Another designation is IL1F3 [IL1 family member 3]. </p>
<p>A gene that may encode the receptor antagonist has been identified as MG50. An IL1 receptor antagonist isolated from the urine of a patient with monocytic leukemia (Seckinger et al, 1987) is identical with IL1ra. </p>
<p>A number of factors have been described that also inhibit the bioactivities of IL1. These factors are not identical with IL1ra and include contra-IL1, M20 interleukin-1 inhibitor, IL1 inhibitory protein, and IL1-L1. </p>
<p>The gene encoding IL1ra (152 amino acids) has been cloned from various sources. The human gene contains four exons and maps to chromosome 2q13-14.1 in the vicinity of the two genes encoding the two molecular forms of IL1 (Lennard et al, 1992; Steinkasserer et al, 1992). </p>
<p>IL1ra is synthesized as a precursor protein containing a classical secretory signal sequence of 25 amino acids that allows the secretion of the factor via the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway. Mouse, rat, human and rabbit IL1ra display approximately 75 % amino acid sequence homology (Carter et al, 1990; Eisenberg et al, 1990; Shuck et al, 1991; Cominelli et al, 1994; Zahedi et al, 1991). IL1ra shows approximately 30 % homology with IL1-beta at the protein level. </p>
<p>Several molecular forms of IL1ra have been identified. One isoform of 17 kDa, termed sIL1ra (s = soluble) or IL1ra1, contains a classical signal sequence and is secreted (Muzio et al, 1995). Two other isoforms, called collectively icIL1ra (intracellular IL1ra) or IL1ra2 (icIL1ra2) and IL1ra3 (icIL1ra3) have no signals sequence, are not secreted and remain strictly intracellular (Muzio et al, 1999; Malyak et al, 1998). These intracellular forms arise by alternative spicing and/or alternative translation initiation (Butcher et al, 1994; Malyak et al, 1998). It has been suggested that these intracellular isoforms may be storage forms that are released upon cell death to limit inflammation caused by cell debris (Muzio et al, 1999). Watson et al (1995) have suggested that the intracellular form of IL1ra functions as a unique intracellular inhibitor that alters IL1-inducible gene expression and attenuates IL1 responses at a point downstream of the initial IL1/IL1 receptor interaction. </p>
<p>IL1ra is found in the conditioned medium of a variety of cells and is produced by macrophages (Janson et al, 1991), monocytes (Lee et al, 1995; Wahl et al, 1993), neutrophils (Roberge et al, 1994; McColl et al, 1992), synovial and dermal fibroblasts (Krzesicki et al, 1993; Silvera et al, 1995), Sertoli cells (Huleihel et al, 2001), human microglial cells (Liu et al, 1998), corneal epithelial cells (Kennedy et al, 1995), retinal epithelial cells (Holtkamp et al, 1999), bronchial epithelial cells (Levine et al, 1997). The soluble form of IL1ra has been shown to be produced by hepatocytes, and to be regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1-beta, and a combination of IL1-beta and IL6) like other acute phase proteins (Gabay et al, 1997). IL4 and IL13 have been shown to amplify the stimulatory effect of IL1-beta on the production of soluble and intracellular forms of IL1ra by both human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cell (Gabay et al, 1999). Systemic inflammation has been shown to cause the production and secretion of the soluble form of IL1ra in the anterior pituitary, probably in response to IL1-beta originating from multiple sources (Wong et al, 1997). </p>
<p>The intracellular form of the receptor antagonist has been found in fibroblasts, monocytes, and neutrophils, keratinocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells (Krzesicki et al, 1993; Haskill et al, 1991; Muzio et al, 1994). icIL1ra is expressed upon cell activation by Jurkat cells, normal CD4(+) lymphocytes from peripheral blood, and by thymocytes, but not by CD8(+) T-cells (Frumento et al, 1997). </p>
<p>IL1ra is a physiologically important regulator of IL1 expression and of physiological responses caused by IL1. It does not seem to act in a species-specific manner (Lederer et al, 1994). </p>
<p>IL1ra functions as a competitive inhibitor of IL1 receptor binding in vitro and in vivo and antagonizes the activities of both molecular forms of IL1 without having agonist effects itself. Binding of IL1ra to the IL1 receptor does not initiate intracellular signal transduction processes normally occurring after engagement of the receptor with IL1 (Dripps et al, 1991; Evans et al, 1995; Granowitz et al, 1991). A serum binding factor for IL1ra, IL1raBF, is most likely a soluble form of the IL1 receptor type 1. </p>
<p>IL1ra inhibits the release of both forms of IL1, the secretion of IL2, and the expression of IL2 receptors on the cell surface (Conti et al, 1992). It also blocks the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis in synovial cells and the proliferation of thymocytes (Balavoine et al, 1986). IL1ra also inhibits the release of leukotriene B4 by human monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Conti et al, 1993). In isolated pancreatic islet cells IL1ra blocks the release of insulin (Dayer-Metroz et al, 1989). </p>
<p>Damtew et al (1993) have studied the effects of IL1ra on the synthesis of various acute phase proteins by human liver cells (Hep 3B cell line) treated with the conditioned medium from monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The authors observe differential responses and show that induction of C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A is essentially abolished, induction of complement component C3 and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 is moderately decreased and induction of fibrinogen is enhanced. Induction of alpha-1 protease inhibitor, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, and ceruloplasmin is not influenced. IL1ra partially blocks the downregulation of the negative acute phase proteins albumin and transferrin. Some acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1) have been shown to induce production of IL1ra by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Tilg et al, 1993). Synergistic effects are observed between these proteins and low concentrations of bacterial endotoxins. </p>
<p>Cells often produce simultaneously IL1 and IL1ra. Matsukawa et al (1997) have studied the tissue-specific production of IL1ra in rabbit tissues. They have reported that constitutive production of soluble IL1ra forms in the lung, liver, spleen, thymus, caecum, skin, kidney, heart, and brain and the simultaneous production of soluble and intracellular forms by thymus, caecum, skin and kidney. icIL1ra appears to be produced constitutively in mouse skin (Gabay et al, 1997). Constitutive expression of molecular forms of IL1ra has been observed in various tissues and cell lines. The regulated expression of IL1ra in various cell types has been shown to be influenced by cytokines and other factors and conditions. In human neutrophils the expression of IL1ra has been shown to be dependent on cell density (Hattar et al, 2001). IFN-gamma modulates the production of IL1ra in activated human neutrophils (McDonald et al, 1998). The synthesis of IL1ra has been shown to be inducible by IL1-beta administration in humans (Bargetzi et al, 1993). The epithelial cell lines A431 and HT29 express icIL1ra mRNA constitutively (Jenkins et al, 1997). The differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in vitro is associated with the constitutive synthesis of IL1ra. This synthesis is enhanced in the presence of GM-CSF (Janson et al, 1991). </p>
<p>In human monocytes the expression of IL1ra is enhanced by IL4, which at the same time also downregulates the production of IL1 and TNF-alpha (Numerof et al, 1992; Orino et al, 1992; Fenton et al, 1992). The effects of IL4 appears to be mediated by the signal transducer STAT6 (Ohmori et al, 1996). Jenkins et al (1993) have observed the induction of IL1ra in monocytes in response to IL1-alpha, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF, while Wahl et al (1993) have reported that TGF-beta causes the sequential activation of IL1-beta and IL1ra. In human monocytes glucocorticoids inhibit IL1ra expression and secretion. The inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids is reversed by IFN-gamma through a mechanism dependent on endogenous IL1 production and by IL4 through a mechanism independent on IL1 (Kovalovsky et al, 1998). In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IL13 induces IL1ra synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Vannier et al, 1996). In synovial fibroblasts the synthesis of IL1ra is markedly enhanced by IL1, TNF-alpha, or PDGF (Martel-Pelletier et al, 1993). Krzesicki et al (1993) have shown that the expression of IL1ra in human synovial fibroblasts and dermal fibroblasts is regulated by IL1-alpha, TNF-alpha, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and that bFGF or PDGF-BB potentiate the effects of IL1-alpha. </p>
<p>IL6 has been shown to induce the synthesis and secretion of IL1ra in Peyer's patches in vivo and in macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro (Jordan et al, 1995). IL10 has been shown to upregulate IL1ra production from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Cassatella et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Subcutaneous administration of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in humans has been shown to cause increases in circulating levels of IL1ra, which may contribute to the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects of IFN (Tilg et al, 1993). </p>
<p>TGF-beta-1 induces IL1ra production and gene expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (Di Febbo et al, 1998). </p>
<p>In human microglial cells IFN-beta induces IL1ra and augments IL1ra expression induced by LPS and IL4. IFN-gamma suppresses the expression of IL1ra caused by IFN-beta and IL4 (Liu et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Leptin can induce the expression and secretion of IL1ra in human monocytic cells. IL1ra has been shown also to antagonize the action of leptin at the hypothalamic level in rodents, thereby inducing leptin resistance and it has been suggested that IL1ra might contribute to the central resistance to leptin in obese patients (Meier et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Levine et al (1997) have reported that icIL1ra and IL1RA expression and secretion into the conditioned medium of in NCI-H292 cells (human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells is upregulated in response to IL4, IL13, IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Ohguchi et al (1998) have reported that Activin A enhances the production of IL1ra in activated THP-1 and U937 human monocytic cells. Berger et al (1993) have reported that GM-CSF and IL4 are inducers of IL1ra in U937 cells differentiated by phorbol esters. IL1-alpha, IL1-beta, and TGF-beta are weak inducers and IL2, PDGF, aFGF, bFGF, EGF, G-CSF, IL3, IL5, IL6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL1ra itself have no effect. </p>
<p>Sciacca et al (2000) have shown that IFN-beta is a potent inducer of IL1ra production in three myelomonocytic cell lines. </p>
<p>Jovcic et al (1996) have studied the recovery of hematopoiesis after sublethal irradiation of CBA mice and demonstrated that IL1ra decreases the number and the proportion of CFU-GM in the S phase in regenerating bone marrow, suppresses BFU-E, and enhances colony growth from CFU-E progenitor cells in a colony formation assay. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an IL1ra gene disruption have been studied in transgenic knock-out mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene (Hirsch et al, 1996). Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IL1ra gene have a lower body mass than wild-type control animals. They are more susceptible than controls to lethal doses of endotoxins (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome) but are less susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Serum levels of IL1 following an endotoxin challenge are decreased in animals lacking IL1ra. </p>
<p>Transgenic animals overproducing IL1ra are protected from the lethal effects of endotoxins but are more susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Serum levels of IL1 following an endotoxin challenge are increased in IL1ra overproducers. </p>
<p>Febrile responses elicited by central injection of human IL1-beta are abolished in these animals. Peripheral injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides in these animals causes fever and increases serum levels of IL1-beta and IL6 to the same extent as in control animals (Lundkvist et al, 1999). </p>
<p>Boggs et al (1995) have demonstrated that systemic production of biologically active human IL1ra can be obtained by retrovirus mediated gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells and that this level of expression and secretion into the serum is compatible with normal bone marrow engraftment, hematopoietic recovery, and survival of the lethally irradiated recipient mice. The authors suggest that these mice may be used as a model to examine the functions of IL1 and IL1ra and to determine the ability of IL1ra to reduce susceptibility to chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis as well as effects of aging such as bone degeneration. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The IL1 receptor antagonist gene has been shown to contain an 86 bp tandem repeat. Several studies suggest an association of allele 2 (IL1RN*2) of this polymorphism (Tarlow et al, 1993) with disease severity in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (Blakemore et al, 1994), ulcerative colitis (Mansfield et al, 1994), and alopecia areata (Tarlow et al, 1994). A significant association between this allele and diabetic nephropathy has been reported by Blakemore et al (1996). For an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the IL1ra gene see: DIRA [deficiency of the IL1 receptor antagonist].  </p>
<p>A recombinant form of IL1ra (Kineret) has been approved for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. IL1ra acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory substance and may be useful also in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diabetes. </p>
<p>IL1ra can prevent the systemic inflammatory response syndrome usually observed during Gram-negative sepsis in animal experiments (Wakabayashi et al, 1991; Ohlsson et al, 1990; Arendt et al, 1991). In an experimental study with human volunteers receiving intravenous injections of Gram-negative endotoxins, systemic administration of IL1ra has been shown to lessen the severity of symptoms (Van Zee et al, 1995). It has been suggested that IL1ra may improve hemorrhagic shock survival by preventing ATP depletion in vital organs (Pellicane et al, 1993). </p>
<p>In experimental animals, pretreatment with IL1ra has been shown to prevent death caused injections of TNF-alpha and IL1 (Everaerdt et al, 1994). Pretreatment with IL1ra also prevents the development of immune-complex induced colitis (Ferretti et al, 1994). </p>
<p>An imbalance between IL1ra and IL1 has been suggested to play a role in human inflammatory bowel disease (Casini-Raggi et al, 1995). </p>
<p>Graft-versus-host reactions have been shown also to be inhibited by administration of IL1ra (McCarthy et al, 1991; Antin et al, 1994). </p>
<p>IL1ra may be of clinical relevance also since it is known that IL1 synthesized by myeloma cells, Hodgkin lymphoma cells, B-cells, T-cells, and a variety of leukemic cell types in turn promotes the synthesis of colony stimulating factors (see: CSF). It has been shown that spontaneous as well as IL1 stimulated proliferation of acute myelogenous leukemia cells in vitro can be inhibited significantly by recombinant IL1ra (see also: Recombinant cytokines) in a dose dependent manner. This effect correlates with a reduction or disappearance in culture conditioned medium of GM-CSF, which is normally secreted by these cells. Northern blot analysis performed on freshly isolated, uncultured leukemic blasts demonstrates constitutive expression of the IL1-beta gene in 19 of 23 AML cases analyzed and simultaneous expression of IL1ra in 3 of 23 cases. An imbalanced secretion of IL1 and its natural receptor antagonist may, therefore, contribute to the unrestricted growth of AML cells (Rambaldi et al, 1993; Estrov et al, 1992). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to inhibit chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) colony growth in a dose-dependent fashion (Estrov et al, 1991). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown also to inhibit augmentation of metastasis induced by IL1 or bacterial lipopolysaccharides in a human melanoma/nude mouse system (Chirivi et al, 1993). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown also to block IL1 mediated induction of expression of human immunodeficiency virus in infected cells (Poli et al, 1994). HIV predominantly induces IL1ra over IL1 synthesis in human primary monocytes (Zavala et al, 1995). These effects may be critical in the control of inflammation associated with HIV infection. </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to suppress allergic eye disease in a mouse model, probably by a down-modulation of the recruitment of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells essential for the immunopathogenesis of ocular atopy (Keane-Myers et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to inhibit recurrence of disease after syngeneic pancreatic islet transplantation to spontaneously diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (Sandberg et al, 1997). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to potentiate the stimulatory effect of human recombinant IL2 on Natural killer cell activity (Conti et al, 1991). </p>
<p>Abbate et al (2008) have reported that Anakinra inhibits cell death by apoptosis in experimental acute myocardial infarction. </p>
