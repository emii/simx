<h1>macrophages</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>abbr. in texts frequently: Mphi. </p>
<p>Macrophages are cells derived from bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (bone marrow-derived macrophages, abbr. BMM; monocyte-derived macrophages, abbr. MDM) (Gordon and Taylor, 2005) that circulate in the blood or have homed in to tissues in the steady state or in response to inflammation. The myeloid progenitor cell in the bone marrow that gives rise to circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells also is the precursor of many different cell types such as neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>The differentiation of macrophages from unipotential progenitor cells and bipotential progenitor cells in the bone marrow is controlled by a variety of cytokines. Hashimoto et al (1999) have reported the analysis of gene expression during this process and describe 35,037 different transcripts expressed in human blood monocytes and macrophages induced by GM-CSF or M-CSF. </p>
<p>Blood monocytes, which can engage in pinocytic and phagocytic activities, migrate in response to various chemotactic factors, and express Fc-gamma receptors and iC3b complement, have been considered to be immature forms of tissue-resident macrophages but can be seen also as a population of circulating macrophages (see also: histiomonocytes). Further differentiation takes place in tissues and the resulting macrophage populations are being referred to as resident macrophages. </p>
<p>Leenen et al (1994) have reviewed a variety of immunological markers recognized by a selected panel of monoclonal antibodies that are characteristic of: macrophage precursors and immature macrophages (ER-MP12, ER-MP20, ER-MP54, ER-MP58), mature macrophages in general (F4/80, BM8, Mac-1, Mac-2, ER-BMDM1), macrophage subsets (ER-HR3, ER-MP23, ER-TR9, Forssman antigen, MOMA-1, MOMA-2, Monts-4, SER-4), and IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages (H-2Ia, LFA-1, ICAM-1, 158.2, MBR-2, TM-2, TM-4, and TM-5). </p>
<p>Normal macrophages (resident macrophages or tissue macrophages; sometimes also referred to as trophic macrophages) can be found in many tissues, including connective tissues, liver, lung, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, serous fluids, skin, and others (for resident macrophages in the heart see: Cardiac tissue macrophages; for specialized germinal center macrophages see: tingible body macrophages; for resident macrophages in adipose tissues see: adipose tissue macrophages (abbr. often ATMs)). Foam cells are lipid-laden macrophages, called also lipophages, associated with atherosclerotic plaques. Siderophages are iron-laden macrophages. Smoker cells are tissue macrophages found in the lungs of smokers. </p>
<p>Multinucleated giant cells are derived by fusion of macrophages. They have the capacity to function like macrophages in host defense against infection and are engaged in the removal of large foreign objects. </p>
<p>Local populations of macrophages are maintained by proliferation of resident progenitor cells and influx of monocytes from blood. Some types of macrophages have special names, depending on where they reside. Macrophages in connective tissue and the skin are often being referred to as histiocytes. One type of macrophages in the skin is known as Langerhans cells. Kupffers cells are macrophages in the liver sinusoids. Osteoclasts are macrophages in the bone. Macrophages in the brain are microglial cells. Placental macrophages are frequently being referred to as Hofbauer cells. Macrophage-like cells in the synovium of cells are synoviomacrophages (called also A-synoviocytes). The term neuronophages has been used for antigen-presenting cells of the brain that are capable of taking up dead neurons by phagocytosis. </p>
<p> Inflammatory macrophages are derived exclusively from monocytes, have similar properties, and are present in various exudates. Some types of macrophages, identified either bei expression of distinct surface markers or by discrete secretion products, may be associated with distinct disease states. </p>
<p> Macrophage populations have been shown to comprise distinct subpopulations that are being referred to generally as polarized macrophages. The term classically activated macrophages (abbr. sometimes CAMPhi; called also M1 macrophages; abbr. Mphi1) refers to macrophages having undergone cell activation in response to LPS or IFN-gamma. Classical M1 macrophages have a pro-inflammatory phenotype and are characterized by high expression of pro-inßammatory cytokines, iNOS expression, and production of reactive oxygen species (Gordon, 2003; Gordon S and Taylor PR, 2005; Martinez et al, 2008). More generally speaking, cell activation of macrophages by Th1 cytokines (which includes IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) is referred to as type 1 activation (Ma et al, 2003). The cytokines expressed by M1 macrophages such as IL1-beta, TNF-alpha, IL12, IL6 are being referred to sometimes as M1 cytokines. The term alternatively activated macrophages (abbr. sometimes AAMPhi or aaMF or AAMs; called also M2 macrophages; abbr. Mphi2) refers to macrophages having undergone cell activation in response to IL4 or glucocorticoids (Gordon, 2003; Martinez et al, 2008; Gordon and Martinez, 2010). These cells have an anti-inflammatory phenotype (for cells with an M2 phenotype see also: adipose tissue macrophages; for an imbalance between M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages involved in metabolic syndromes see also: metainflammation). More generally speaking, cell activation of macrophages by Th2 cytokines (which includes IL4 and IL13) is referred to as type 2 activation (Ma et al, 2003). Alternatively activated macrophages generated in vivo have a gene expression profile distinct from other macrophage populations (Loke et al, 2002). The cytokines expressed by M2 macrophages such as IL10, IL1ra, TGF-beta are being referred to sometimes as M2 cytokines. </p>
<p>M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages are thought to represent two extremes of a spectrum of macrophage activation states (Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Murray and Wynn, 2011; Gordon and Martinez, 2010). M1 macrophages are characterized by high expression of IL12 and IL23, and low expression of IL10 and generally have immunostimulatory properties oriented towards Th1 cell activation. They kill intracellular pathogens, and have antitumoral activity. M2 macrophages express love levels of IL12 and IL-23, and express high levels of IL10 and CD206 as well as scavenger receptors. M2 macrophages have poor antigen-presenting capacity, promote angiogenesis, tissue remodelling and repair; and suppress immunity involving Th1 cells. They support Th2 cell responses necessary for killing and encapsulation of parasites (Martinez FO et al, 2008; Martinez FO et al, 2009).  </p>
<p>Both types of activated cells can co-exist and show differences in their capacity to secrete mediators and to express receptors (see, for example, Kordelja et al, 1997; Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Martinez FO et al, 2006). Thus, these cells participate to different extents in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune reactions. Particle-mediated cell activation of macrophages also differs from type 1 or type activated cells in gene expression patterns (Ma et al, 2003). M2 macrophages express high levels of mannose receptor, dectin-1, and arginase. M2 subsets have been characterized (Gordon and Taylor, 2005) and include M2 macrophages activated by IL4 or IL13 (referred to also as M2a macrophages (Martinez et al, 2008), macrophages activated by immune complexes (referred to also as M2b macrophages), and macrophages polarized with glucocorticoids or IL10 (M2c macrophages) (Martinez et al, 2008). </p>
<p>The term macrophage deactivation refers to a reversal of the activated state. This process requires the presence of a variety of mediators. </p>
<p>M4 macrophages define a macrophage differentiation step that differs from M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages (Gleissner et al, 2010). M4 macrophages are induced by the chemokine CXCL4 derived from platelets, and their transcriptome differs markedly from the other two differentiation types. </p>
<p>The different types of macrophages constitute a heterogeneous population of cells that differ in their origin and differentiation stage and may have been subject to different tissue-specific micro-environmental influences. These cells thus can display a range of functional and morphological phenotypes (expression of membrane-bound and secretory products). Mosser and Edwards (2008) have reviewed the biology of different subpopulations of macrophages and have suggested a macrophage classification scheme based on the fundamental macrophage functions that are involved in maintaining homeostasis. Host defence macrophages correspond to M1 macrophages. In addition, a distinction is made between wound healing macrophages and regulatory macrophages engaged in immune regulation. Macrophages can evolve to exhibit characteristics that are shared by more than one macrophage population and probably constitute a spectrum of cell types with shared or specific activities. The term regulatory macrophages has been used to describe a population of macrophages that produces high levels of IL10 and low levels of IL12 and IL23. These macrophages also produce HB-EGF (Edwards et al, 2009). </p>
<p> CD4(+) CD8(+) macrophages have been shown to constitute a unique subpopulation of cytotoxic macrophages that kill tumor cells by mechanisms involving NKG2D receptors, granzymes and perforin (Baba et al, 2008).  Tumor-associated macrophages (abbr. TAM) are highly active resident immune effector cells found in the stroma of tumors. They may either positively or negatively regulate the growth of various malignant cells (see also: TIL [tumor infiltrating lymphocytes]) (Ohno et al, 2003; Mantovani et al, 2002; Sica et al, 2002). Resting TAMs have been shown to express the immunosuppressive cytokine IL10, phagocytosis-related receptors/molecules (Msr2 and C1q), inflammatory chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5) and chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL16), the expression of which is inducible by interferons. Cell activation of TAMs by lipopolysaccharides interferes with the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1-beta, IL6, TNF-alpha) and chemokines (CCL3), but upregulates the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL10, TGF-beta) and IFN inducible chemokines (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL16) (Biswas et al, 2006). Duff et al (2007) have reported gene expression patterns of TAMs, which reveal that these cells are distinct from both wound and peritoneal macrophages. </p>
<p>Resident macrophages retain some proliferative capacity, can engage in phagocytosis, can respond to various stimuli, but are otherwise relative quiescent with respect to immunological and secretory functions. </p>
<p>Macrophages participate in all phases of the immune response as phagocytic cells, and functionally distinct macrophage populations provide for very flexible immune responses. They play a key role in host defences against intracellular parasitic micro-organisms and tumor cells. Macrophages, through their secretory products, control inflammation, changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix, tissue reorganization, angiogenesis, and other processes. These cells can be cytotoxic for other cells (K cells) and can kill or damage extracellular targets by means of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Macrophages constitute an important link between the innate and adaptive immune systems through presentation of antigens to T-cells and production of cytokines and chemokines. The capacity of macrophages to participate in these and other processes by directly or indirectly influencing the bioactivities of other cells may depend on the developmental stage and also depends largely on cell activation. Tissue macrophages play a critical role in wound healing by producing chemoattractants recruiting and activating additional macrophages, growth factors promoting cellular proliferation, proteases and extracellular matrix molecules, and factors restraining tissue growth once repair is completed. For macrophages that antagonize immune responses see: suppressor macrophages. </p>
<p>Macrophages have the capacity to secrete a plethora of cytokines, growth factors, and other mediators (Nathan, 1987), which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Some mediators are produced constitutively, others are produced only after cell activation. The cells are said to have become 'stimulated', 'activated', 'induced', 'elicited', etc, and these terms are often used interchangeably. Frequently, any distinctions made to describe degrees of cell activation are more or less arbitrary. Depending in large part on the nature of the stimuli, macrophages may be primed only for selected functions and may not attain the full spectrum of functional capacities. Distinct subpopulations of macrophages or differently activated macrophages display various functions in immune reactions and this may be reflected by differences in the factors they produce, and the mediators they respond to, under various circumstances. </p>
<p>Numerous studies have been carried out to identify genes expressed or repressed specifically in macrophages in response to a variety of stimuli. Chaussabel et al (2003) have compared gene expression profiles in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages generated in vitro from the same individual blood donors and exposed to 5 different pathogens. These analyses demonstrate dendritic cells and macrophages constitutively express approximately 4000 genes, 96 % of which are shared between the 2 cell types. Unique expression patterns are found in response to each pathogen. Li et al (2004) have reported the results of a gene expression profiling study aimed at identifying genes expressed or repressed specifically in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Gene expression profiling of bovine macrophages in response to Escherichia coli O157:H7 lipopolysaccharide has been reported by Chitko-McKown et al (2004). Kohro et al (2004) have reported a comparison of the differences in gene expression profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages and THP-1 cells differentiated in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Rodriguez et al (2004) have compared gene expression patterns in macrophages after phagocytosis of Leishmania chagasi with those observed after treatment with lipopolysaccharides and IFN-gamma. Chaussabel et al (2003) have compared gene expression patterns in human macrophages and dendritic cells. In the absence of microbial stimulation, dendritic cells and macrophages constitutively express approximately 4000 genes, 96 % of which are shared between the 2 cell types. The genes altered transcriptionally in both cell types following pathogen exposure are largely cell specific. Ragno et al (2001) have reported changes in gene expression that occur in the human macrophage cell line, THP1 following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Gustafsson et al (2008) have used micro-arrays comprising approximately 14,000 genes and compare the gene expression patterns of human first trimester decidual CD14(+) monocytes / macrophages with the expression profile of the corresponding cells in blood. Guerfali et al (2008) have reported the gene expression profile of human macrophages infected with Leishmania major parasites. Edwards et al (2006) have reported expression profiles and gene signatures for M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and type 2 activation.  </p>
<p> Macrophages have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
