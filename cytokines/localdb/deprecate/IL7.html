<h1>IL7</h1>

    <h2>IL7</h2>
    
<p>Interleukin-7. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>B-cell precursor growth-promoting activity; Lpo-1 (lymphopoietin-1); LP-1 (lymphopoietin-1); PBGF (Pre-B-cell growth factor); serum factor from patients with ulcerative colitis Thymocyte growth factor. See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL7 is secreted constitutively into the conditioned medium of adherent bone marrow stromal cells (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture) and thymic cells. Murine and human keratinocytes have been shown also to express and secrete IL7. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>Murine IL7 is a glycoprotein of 25 kDa that contains six cysteine residues. It is derived from a precursor protein containing a classical secretory signal sequence of 25 amino acids. The disulfide bonds are essential for the biological activity of the protein. </p>
<p>Human (152 amino acids; 17.4 kDa) and murine IL7 (129 amino acids) show 60 % sequence homology at the protein level. The human protein is 17 amino acids longer than the murine protein since the human gene contains an additional exon. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL7 gene has a length of approximately 33 kb and contains six exons. The gene maps to chromosome 8q12-q13. The murine IL7 gene maps to chromosome 3. It has a length of approximately 56 kb and contains five exons. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The human IL7 receptor is an integral strongly glycosylated membrane proteins of 76 kDa expressed on activated T-cells. This receptor has been designated as CD127. In addition there is a second (unrelated) receptor form of 90 kDa that is expressed also on unstimulated human T-cells. The receptor gene encoding the p90 receptor molecules maps to chromosome 5p13. The ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to proliferate in response to IL7 correlates with the expression of the 76 kDa receptor, and not with the expression of the 90 kDa form. The IL7 receptor may contain other components in addition to the p90 and p70 IL7 binding species. </p>
<p>IL7 receptors are expressed on pre-B-cells and their progenitors. They are not expressed on mature B-cells. IL7 receptors are expressed also on bone marrow macrophages. Functional IL7 receptors are found on the cell surface of multiphenotypic, biphenotypic, and immature lymphoid progenitors of B-cells with the gene arrangement of the heavy immunoglobulin chain such as those observed in the germ line. Cells expressing the heavy chain of immunoglobulin or cells that have undergone gene arrangements do not express the receptor. </p>
<p>A soluble IL7 receptor form has been described also. Such soluble receptors and binding proteins have been found also for IL1 (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), IL2, IL4, IL6, IGF, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. They probably function as physiological regulators of cytokine activities (see also: Cytokine inhibitors) by inhibiting receptor binding or act as transport proteins. </p>
<p>After binding of IL7 to its receptor the receptor associates with a non-receptor protein kinase called fyn, which appears to mediate some of the intracellular signals. One signaling component of the IL7 receptor has been shown recently to be identical with the gamma subunit of the IL2 receptor. This subunit is also a component of the IL4 receptor and is probably also shared with the IL13 receptor. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The activity of human IL7 is not species-specific. IL7 stimulates the proliferation of pre-B and pro-B-cells without affecting their differentiation. IL7 can replace murine bone marrow stromal cells in supporting the extended growth of both pre-B-cells and pro-B-cells (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture). The protein does not act on mature B-cells. The IL7 dependent proliferation of the precursors of B-cells is inhibited by TGF-beta (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). IL7 also selectively supports the maturation of megakaryocytes. In normal pre-B-cells IL7 induces the expression of the myc oncogene. TSLP [thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin] can replace the activity of IL7 in supporting the in vitro development of B-cells. </p>
<p>Some of the effects of IL7 on natural killer cells appear to be mediated by TNF-alpha since the effects of IL7 are inhibited by an antibody directed against TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>IL7 stimulates the proliferation of early and mature activated T-cells and this activity is synergised by suboptimal doses of IL1. Unstimulated human T-cells, which also express high affinity IL7 receptors, do not proliferate in response to IL7. IL7 stimulates the proliferation of thymocytes with the markers CD4(-) CD8(-), CD4(+) CD8(-), CD4(-) CD8(+) and is therefore an important differentiation factor for functionally different subpopulation of T-lymphocytes. Thymocytes proliferate in response to IL7 independently of three other known T-cell growth factors, IL2, IL4, and IL7. </p>
<p>In human peripheral monocytes IL7 induces the synthesis of some inflammatory mediators such as IL1, IL6 and MIP (macrophage inflammatory protein). IL7 also enhances the expression and secretion of IL3 and GM-CSF in activated human T-cells. IL7 downregulates expression of TGF-beta in macrophages, which has been suggested as an inhibitor of the antitumor immune response. </p>
<p>IL7 has been found to sustain the expression of genes known to control rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta gene and to be a cofactor for such rearrangements during early development of T-cells in mice. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The role of IL7 in the development of the lymphoid system has been studied in transgenic mice carrying an IL7 cDNA fused to an immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. The transgene is expressed in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and skin. The expression of the transgene leads to a perturbation of the development of T-cells characterized by a marked reduction of CD4(+) CD8(+) (double-positive) thymocytes. The animals also develop a progressive cutaneous disorder involving a dermal lymphoid infiltrate that results in progressive alopecia, hyperkeratosis, and exfoliation. The expression of the transgene also provokes the development of a lymphoproliferative disorder that induces B-cell and T-cell lymphomas within the first 4 months of life, demonstrating that IL7 can act as an oncogene in the living organism. </p>
<p>A high incidence of severe lymphoproliferative disease has been observed also in a newly generated strain of transgenic mice expressing murine IL7 under the control of the E-alpha (MHC class 2) promoter. These animals are characterized by the selective expansion of cells at an early stage in the development of B-cells and expansion of cells phenotypically identical with bipotent (B/macrophage) stem cell populations found in midgestation embryonic liver. These cells are oligoclonal, or in rare cases monoclonal, and include clones of cells with unrearranged Ig heavy chain loci. </p>
<p>Mertsching et al (1995, 1996) have analyzed the development of B-cells in transgenic mice expressing murine IL7 under the control of the mouse MHC class 2 (E alpha) promoter. B-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow is dramatically altered and the number of pro/pre-B and immature B-cells is significantly increased. pro/pre-B and immature B-cells persist in the spleens of adult transgenic mice and are also present in lymph nodes and blood. Limiting dilution analysis shows that the number of clonable pre-B-cells is significantly increased and that at limiting dilution, growth of transgenic pre-B-cells is still dependent on exogenous IL7. </p>
<p>He et al (1996) have shown that Gamma-Delta T-cells were absent in mice deficient in IL7 receptor-alpha expression. Development and function of natural killer cells are normal. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL7 can be assayed by its growth-promoting activity on pre-B-cells in Whitlock-Witte long-term bone marrow cultures. It can be assayed also in bioassays employing cell lines that respond to the factor (see: 1xN/2b; 2E8; CT6; DW34; MH11; Nb2). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL7 may be of clinical significance for Adoptive immunotherapy since it is capable in vivo to cause the CD4(+) T-cell dependent destruction of tumor cells (see also: LAK cells, lymphokine activated killer cells; see also: Adoptive immunotherapy). A comparison of the activities of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes induced by IL7 or IL2 shows similar activities on lung metastases of murine sarcomas. IL7 has been shown also to induce LAK cells activity comparable quantitatively to that induced by IL2 in cells obtained from patients early after autologous or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation. It induces an even greater LAK cells activity in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained after autologous bone marrow transplantation and preactivated in vivo by IL2 therapy. It has therefore been suggested that IL7, alone or in combination with IL2, may be used as a consolidative immunotherapy for malignancies in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. </p>
<p>The administration of human recombinant IL7 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) to normal and irradiated mice increases the numbers of lymphocytes and some immature cells of the myeloid lineage. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL7 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>A participation of IL7 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas is suggested by the growth-promoting effects of IL7 and its synthesis by keratinocytes. </p>
<p>IL7 may contribute to disturbances of immune regulatory T-cells in ulcerative colitis since a serum factor from patients with ulcerative colitis that induces proliferation of intrathymic T-cells has been found to be identical with IL7 (Watanabe et al, 1997). </p>
