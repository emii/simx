    <h2>CD54</h2>
    
<p> </p>
<p>Other designations: </p>
<p>7F7 BB2 human rhinovirus receptor ICAM-1 [intercellular adhesion molecule 1] IFN-gamma regulated human melanoma-associated antigen Ly47 MALA-2 (mouse) Me14-D12 P3.58 </p>
<p> The antigen is expressed on hematopoietic cells and non-hematopoietic cells. </p>
<p>The counterreceptor for CD54 is LFA-1 (CD11a) (Bella et al, 1998). </p>
<p>The lack of CD54 expression in knock-out mice has been shown to impair inflammatory and immune responses (Sligh et al, 1993). </p>
