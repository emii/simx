<h1>lymphocytes</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>Lymphocytes are the primary cells of an immune response. Most lymphocytes are located in lymphoid tissues and only a very small portion circulate in the blood. The most important types are the T-cells, B-cells, and mature B-cells (plasma cells). </p>
<p>The process leading to the formation of lymphocytes is called lymphopoiesis. Initial lymphopoiesis takes place in bone marrow. Maturation takes places in lymph nodes, and the thymus. These initial phases of lymphopoiesis do not require exposure of the cells to antigens. An antigen-dependent phase of lymphopoiesis involves a second cycle of differentiation and proliferation when the cells are exposed to antigens (Golden-Mason and O'Farrelly, 2002; Hirose et al, 2002; Medina and Singh, 2005; Plum and Leclercq, 2000). </p>
<p>The neoplastic transformation and proliferation of morphologically immature lymphocytes leads to Acute lymphoid leukemia (called also Acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; abbr. ALL). This can involve B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. The neoplastic transformation and proliferation of lymphoid cells that usually involves a morphologically mature lymphocytes leads to Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). </p>
