<h1>CCL27</h1>

    <h2>CCL27</h2>
    
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 27, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 27] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL27 is the new designation of ALP, CTACK [cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine], ESkine, ILC [interleukin-11 receptor alpha-locus chemokine; IL11Ralpha-locus chemokine], PESKY, skinkine. An older designation is SCYA27 [small inducible cytokine A27]. </p>

    <h2>ALP</h2>
    
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) This murine protein, designated ALP for its amino terminal peptide sequence, belongs to the group of CC-Chemokines to which it is distantly related (37 % identity with murine Exodus-1). If differs from these chemokines by a unique amino terminal peptide sequence. Unlike other members of the group of CC-Chemokines ALP is expressed preferentially in testis, heart, and liver (Hromas et al, 1999). </p>
<p>The factor has been renamed CCL27. The gene symbol is SCYA27. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. CCL27 is the new designation of CTACK (cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine), ESkine, ILC (interleukin-11 receptor alpha-locus chemokine; IL11Ralpha-locus chemokine), PESKY, skinkine. </p>

    <h2>CTACK</h2>
    
<p>[cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine] The factor has been renamed CCL27. The gene symbol is SCYA27. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. CCL27 is the new designation of ALP, ESkine, ILC (interleukin-11 receptor alpha-locus chemokine; IL11Ralpha-locus chemokine), PESKY, skinkine </p>
<p>This protein of 112 amino acids is one of the CC-Chemokines. Human and mouse CTACK appear to be expressed specifically in skin (mouse epidermis and human keratinocytes). The factor is produced constitutively by keratinocytes. Stimulation TNF-alpha and IL1-beta also induces expression. CTACK selectively attracts circulating memory T-cells specifically expressing the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen CLA. The receptor is CCR10. </p>
