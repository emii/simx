    <h2>IL17</h2>
    
<p>[Interleukin-17] also being referred to as IL17A. The cDNA encoding human IL17 was isolated from a library of CD4(+) T-cells. It encodes a glycoprotein of 155 amino acids sequence which exhibits 72 % amino acid identity with HVS13, an open reading frame from a T-lymphotropic Herpesvirus saimiri, and 63 % with murine CTLA-8 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 8; cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 8). For a heterodimer consisting of IL17A and IL17F see: IL17A/F. </p>
<p>High levels of an IL17 homodimer are produced by stimulated primary peripheral blood CD4(+) T-cells. IL17 enhances expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1 (CD54)) in human fibroblasts. Human IL17 also stimulates epithelial, endothelial, or fibroblastic cells to secrete IL6, IL8, and G-CSF and prostaglandin E2. In the presence of human IL17, fibroblasts can sustain the proliferation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors and their preferential maturation into neutrophils (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p>IL17 functions as a mediator of angiogenesis that stimulates migration of vascular endothelial cells and cord formation and regulates production of a variety of growth factors promoting angiogenesis (Numasaki et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Mouse, rat, and human IL17 can induce IL6 secretion in mouse stromal cells, indicating that all homologous proteins can recognize the mouse receptor. IL17 binds to a receptor that binds to HVS13 (referred to as viral IL17) and to CTLA-8. </p>
<p>Chauhan et al (2011) have elucidated the distinct mechanisms by which IL17 induces lymphangiogenesis. IL17 directly promotes the growth of lymphatic vessels by inducing increased expression of VEGF-D and proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells. IL17-induced growth of blood vessels is mediated primarily through IL1-beta secretion by IL17-responsive cells. In vivo blockade of IL17 in a preclinical model of Th17-dominant autoimmune ocular disease demonstrates a significant reduction in the corneal lymphangiogenesis and in the progression of clinical disease.  </p>
<p>The IL17 protein family binds to a unique mouse receptor (see: IL17RA). A cDNA encoding a human homolog (CD217) of the murine IL17 receptor isolated from a human T-cell library is 69 % identical with the murine receptor and shares no homology with previously identified cytokine receptor families. Expression of the human receptor gene displays a broad tissue distribution. The human gene was localized to chromosome 22. Recombinant human IL17 binds to the human receptor with low affinity. Receptor complexes have been shown to consist of IL17RA, IL17RC, or IL17RD. </p>
