<h1>monocytes</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>Monocytes are essentially immature macrophages. After their formation and release by the bone marrow, these cells enter the bloodstream and circulate for about 36 hours while they mature into macrophages. Sessile macrophages are the tissue counterparts of monocytes of peripheral blood. Sometimes, the term histiocytes is used for these cells. Monocytes together with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) are being referred to collectively as myelomonocytic cells. The term plasmacytoid monocytes refers to a population of cells known also as T-associated plasma cells, plasmacytoid T-cells, plasmacytoid predendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or natural IFN-producing cells. See also: dendritic cells. </p>
<p> The frequently used terms inflammatory monocytes or pro-inflammatory monocytes refer to one subset of monocytes with high level expression of Ly6C, high levels of the chemokine receptor CCR2, and low levels of CX3CR1. The term inflammatory monocytes reflects the observation that cells belonging to this subset preferentially migrate to sites of inflammation (Geissmann et al, 2003). This monocyte subset corresponds to CD14(++) CD16(-) monocytes in humans and is being referred to also as classical monocytes (Belge et al, 2002) (as opposed to nonclassical monocytes, which, however, may also be inflammatory monocytes) (Strauss-Ayali et al, 2007). Use of these terms is not recommended (Ziegler-Heitbrock et al, 2010), because the label inflammatory has been used for different subpopulations in humans and mice. It has been pointed out also that these terms may prematurely ascribe functional attributes to cells based on ex vivo studies while they largely remain to be functionally characterized in vivo. Burke et al (2008) have reported that murine CD43(+) monocytes exhibit features of pro-inflammatory monocytes and are functionally homologeous to the human CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes. </p>
<p>Human monocytes can be subdivided into 3 subsets on the basis of the expression of CD14 and CD16 (Strauss-Ayali et al, 2007; Ziegler-Heitbrock et al, 2010). Monocytes with high CD14 expression but no CD16 expression are being referred to as classical monocytes (CD14(high) CD16(-) monocytes). The corresponding subset of mouse monocytes is Ly6C(++) CD43(+) monocytes (Ly6C(high) CD43(+) monocytes).  </p>
<p>Intermediate monocytes are those showing a high level of CD14 together with low levels of CD16 (CD14(high) CD16(+) monocytes). The corresponding subset of mouse monocytes is Ly6C(++) CD43(++) monocytes (Ly6C(high) CD43(high) monocytes).  </p>
<p>Nonclassical monocytes express a low level of CD14 together with high CD16 (CD14(+) CD16(high) monocytes). Without further characterization, CD16(+) monocytes, therefore may comprise intermediate monocytes and nonclassical monocytes. The corresponding subset of mouse monocytes is Ly6C(+) CD43(++) monocytes (Ly6C(+) CD43(high) monocytes).  </p>
<p>Expression data for all three subsets show a close relationship between intermediate monocytes and nonclassic monocytes but also distinct features that separate these two populations from one another (Wong et al, 2011). Expression information about intermediate monocytes has been reported also by Zawada et al (2011).  </p>
<p> Venneri et al (2007) have identified a distinct subpopulation of murine monocytes, which they have designated TEM [TIE2-expressing monocytes]. These cells appear to have a non-redundant function in promoting tumor angiogenesis and growth in mouse models (De Palma and Naldini, 2009). These cells are characterized by the expression of the TIE-2 angiopoietin receptor and required for the vascularization and growth of several tumor models. TIE-2 expression in human blood identifies a subset of monocytes distinct from classical inflammatory monocytes and comprised within the less abundant "resident" population. These cells account for 2-7 % of blood mononuclear cells in healthy donors and are distinct from rare circulating endothelial cells and progenitors. In human cancer patients, these cells are found in the blood and also within tumors, where they represent the main monocyte population distinct from tumor-associated macrophages. These cells are hardly detected in non-neoplastic tissues. In vitro, TEMs migrate towards the TIE-2 ligand angiopoietin-2. Release of angiopoietin-2 from activated endothelial cells and angiogenic vessels may thus be responsible for the preferential accumulation of these cells within tumors. Purified human TEMs, but not TEM-depleted monocytes, markedly promote angiogenesis in xenotransplanted human tumors, suggesting a role of these cells in human cancer progression. </p>
<p>Medbury et al (2008) have reported that monocytes can transform into fibrocytes. Thus, monocytes may play a more crucial role in the clinical outcome of atherosclerosis than previously realized as they not only contribute directly to plaque instability (through foam cell formation), but also promote plaque stability by transformation into a fibrocyte. </p>
<p> Monocytes have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
