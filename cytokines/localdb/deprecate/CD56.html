<p>Other designations: </p>
<p>5.1.H11 (name of monoclonal antibody) BASCA [brain-associated small cell lung cancer antigen] Leu19 MSK39 (name of monoclonal antibody) NCAM [neural cell adhesion molecule] NCAM1 [neural cell adhesion molecule-1] NCAM-120 (a 120 kDa isoform) NCAM-140 (a 140 kDa isoform) NCAM-180 (a 180 kDa isoform) NCAM-H NCAM-L NKH-1 PSA-NCAM (a polysialylated isoform) </p>
<p>Numerous isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of NCAM mRNA have been reported. Adult tissues express three major isoforms. The 120 kDa protein NCAM-120 is linked to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The 140 kDa NCAM-140 has a transmembrane component and a cytoplasmic tail with unknown function. A 180 kDa isoform (NCAM-180) binds the cytoskeleton. NCAM-180 is the isoform found in colonocytes, and loss of expression is associated with clinically aggressive colon cancers. For E-NCAM [embryonic NCAM], a highly polysialylated embryonic form of this protein, see: NCAM. </p>
<p>The antigen is expressed on natural killer cells (80-90%), T-cells after cell activation, at neuromuscular junctions, in normal neuroendocrine tissues, Schwann cells. </p>
<p>Paratcha et al (2003) have reported that the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is an alternative signaling receptor for GDNF family ligands that operates independently of ret, the signaling component of the GDNF receptor. </p>
<p>Thoulouze et al (1998) have reported that CD56 can serve as a receptor for rabies virus. </p>
<p>Palser et al (2009) have suggested that NCAM may play a role in axon / oligodendrocyte signalling during myelination, leading to an increase in oligodendrocyte survival and process outgrowth following axonal contact. </p>
<p>High expression of CD56 on subsets of NK-cells are a characteristic of regulatory NK-cells with immunomodulatory rather than cytotoxic functions. </p>
