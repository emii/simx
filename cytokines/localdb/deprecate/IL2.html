<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>Under physiological conditions IL2 is produced mainly by T-cells expressing the surface antigen CD4 following cell activation by mitogens or allogens. Several secondary signals are required for maximal expression of IL2. Resting cells do not produce IL2. In vitro the synthesis of IL2 is inhibited by dexamethasone or CsA (Cyclosporin A). Transformed T-cells and B-cells, leukemia cells, LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells) and NK-cells also secrete IL2. Vitamin E can enhance the production of IL2. With increasing age the antigen- and mitogen-stimulated synthesis of IL2 and hence also T-cell mediated immune responses decrease. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL2 is a protein of 133 amino acids (15.4 kDa) with a slightly basic pI. It does not display sequence homology to any other factors. Murine and human IL2 display a homology of approximately 65 %. IL2 is synthesized as a precursor protein of 153 amino acids with the first 20 aminoterminal amino acids functioning as a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence. The protein contains a single disulfide bond (positions Cys58/105) essential for biological activity. </p>
<p>IL2 is O-glycosylated at threonine at position 3. Variants with different molecular masses and charges are due to variable glycosylation. Non-glycosylated IL2 is also biologically active. Glycosylation appears to promote elimination of the factor by hepatocytes. </p>
<p>For a human recombinant fusion protein consisting of IL6 and IL2 see: CH925. For dimerized forms of IL2 see: IL2 dimers. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL2 gene contains four exons. The IL2 gene maps to human chromosome 4q26-28 (murine chromosome 3). Translocations, deletions, and/or chromosomal gene amplifications of the IL2 gene have been observed neither under physiological nor under pathological conditions (see: 5q minus syndrome for other cytokines). </p>
<p>The homology of murine and human IL2 is 72 % at the nucleotide level in the coding region. </p>
<p>The synthesis of IL2 is regulated at the level of transcription (see also: ARRE). T-cells contain a labile repressor that modulates the post-transcriptional processing of IL2 mRNA precursors. This repressor prevents post-transcriptional processing so that approximately 98 % of the IL2 mRNA remain unprocessed. </p>
<p>The promoter region of the IL2 gene contains several binding sites for specific transcription factors (see also: gene expression) that allows the regulated activation or repression of IL2 gene activity. The transcription factor NF-AT regulates the expression of the IL2 gene in T-cells. A factor designated TCF-8, prevents IL2 gene expression. A factor designated CIF (colostrum inhibitory factor) has been shown to block the accumulation of IL2 mRNA in certain cell lines. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL2 are mediated by a membrane receptor that is expressed almost exclusively on activated, but not on resting, T-cells (see also: cell activation) at densities of 4-12x10**3 receptors/cell. Activated B-cells and resting mononuclear leukocytes rarely express this receptor. The expression of the IL2 receptor is modulated by IL5 and IL6. For other factors specifically influencing IL2 receptor expression see: IL2R/p55 inducing factor, IL2 receptor inducing factor, IL2R-alpha chain inhibitory activity. </p>
<p>Three different types of IL2 receptors are distinguished that are expressed differentially and independently. The high affinity IL2 receptor (Kdis ~ 10 pM) constitutes approximately 10 % of all IL2 receptors expressed by a cells. This receptor is a membrane receptor complex consisting of the two subunits IL2R-alpha (TAC antigen =T-cell activation antigen; p55) and IL2R-beta (p75; new designation: CD122, see also: CD antigens) as the ligand binding domains and a gamma chain as a signaling component (see below). p75 is expressed constitutively on resting T-lymphocytes, NK-cells, and a number of other cell types while the expression of p55 is usually observed only after cell activation. p55 is, however, synthesized constitutively by a number of tumor cells and by HTLV-I-infected cells. </p>
<p>IL2 receptor expression of monocytes is induced by IFN-gamma, so that these cells become tumor-cytotoxic. In T-cells the expression of p75 can be reduced by IL3. </p>
<p>An intermediate affinity IL2 receptor (Kdis = 100 pM) consists of the p75 subunit and a gamma chain (see below) while a low affinity receptor (Kdis = 10 nM) is formed by p55 alone. </p>
<p>p55 has a length of 251 amino acids with an extracellular domain of 219 amino acids an a very short cytoplasmic domain of 13 amino acids. The p55 gene maps to human chromosome 10p14-p15. The expression of p55 is regulated by a nuclear protein called RPT-1. </p>
<p>p75 has a length of 525 amino acids with an extracellular domain of 214 amino acids an a cytoplasmic domain of 286 amino acids. The p75 gene contains 10 exons and has a length of approximately 24 kb. It maps to human chromosome 22q11. 2-q12 and to murine chromosome 15 (band E). </p>
<p>A third 64 kDa subunit of the IL2 receptor, designated gamma, has been described recently. Murine and human gamma subunits of the receptor have approximately 70 % sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. This subunit is required for the generation of high and intermediate affinity IL2 receptors but does not bind IL2 by itself. These two receptor types consist of a alpha-beta-gamma heterotrimer and a beta-gamma heterodimer, respectively. The gene encoding the gamma subunit of the IL2 receptor maps to human chromosome Xq13, spans approximately 4.2 kb and contains eight exons. Relationships to markers in linkage studies suggest that this gene and SCIDX1, the gene for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, have the same location. Moreover, in each of 3 unrelated patients with X-linked SCID, a different mutation in the IL2R-gamma gene has been observed. The gamma subunit of the IL2 receptor has been shown recently to be a component of the receptors for IL4 and IL7. It is probably also a component of the IL13 receptor. These findings can explain the severity of the immune defect in X-linked immunodeficiency. </p>
<p>The amino acids at positions 267-317 lying directly adjacent to the transmembrane region of p75 are involved in IL2 mediated signal transduction. In addition the IL2 receptor is associated with a number of other proteins (p22, p40, p100) which are thought to be involved in mediating conformational changes in the receptor chains, receptor mediated endocytosis, and further signal transduction processes. One of the identified proteins is the 95 kDa cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD54) which probably focuses IL2 receptors at regions of cell-to-cell contacts and thus may mediate paracrine activities, for example, during IL2 mediated stimulation of T-cells. Another protein associated with p75 is a tyrosine-specific protein kinase called lck. The observation that proliferation of cells induced by IL2 is inhibited by specific inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases in an lck negative cell line suggests that other kinases may be associated also with IL2 receptors. Two such kinases, called fyn and lyn, have been identified. In addition, IL2 receptor signaling may be mediated also by vav. </p>
<p>Activated lymphocytes continuously secrete a 42 kDa fragment of the TAC antigen. This fragment circulates in the serum and plasma and functions as a soluble IL2 receptor (sIL2R). The concentrations of this soluble receptor vary markedly in different pathological situations, for example, infections, autoimmune diseases, leukemias, or after organ transplantation. Levels may increase up to 100-fold. The levels of sIL2R appear to correlate with the severity of HIV-induces diseases and may be of diagnostic value also in other settings. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Mouse and human IL2 both cause proliferation of T-cells of the homologous species at high efficiency. Human IL2 also stimulates proliferation of mouse T-cells at similar concentrations, whereas mouse IL2 stimulates human T-cells at a lower (sixfold to 170-fold) efficiency. </p>
<p>IL2 is a growth factor for all subpopulations of T-lymphocytes. It is an antigen-unspecific proliferation factor for T-cells that induces Cell cycle progression in resting cells and thus allows clonal expansion of activated T-lymphocytes. This effect is modulated by hormones such as Prolactin. </p>
<p>The p55 receptor subunit is expressed in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Since freshly isolated leukemic cells also secrete IL2 and respond to it IL2 may function as an autocrine growth modulator for these cells capable of worsening ATL. </p>
<p>IL2 also promotes the proliferation of activated B-cells also this requires the presence of additional factors, for example, IL4. In vitro IL2 also stimulates the growth of oligodendroglial cells. </p>
<p>Due to its effects on T-cells and B-cells IL2 is a central regulator of immune responses. It also plays a role in anti-inflammatory reactions, in hematopoiesis and in tumor surveillance. IL2 stimulates the synthesis of IFN-gamma in peripheral leukocytes and also induces the secretion of IL1, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta. </p>
<p>The induction of the secretion of tumoricidal cytokines apart from the activity in the expansion of LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells) are probably the main factors responsible for the antitumor activity of IL2. </p>
<p>IL2 damages the blood-brain barrier and the integrity of the endothelium of brain vessel. Waguespack et al (1994) have shown that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier by a saturable transport system. These effects may be the underlying causes of neuropsychiatric side effects such as fatigue, disorientation, and depression, frequently observed under IL2 therapy. IL2 also alters the electrophysiological behavior of neurons. </p>
<p>A dimeric form of human IL2, produced by the action of a transglutaminase isolated from regenerating fish optic nerves, has been shown to be a cytotoxic factor for rat brain oligodendrocytes in culture. It has been suggested that dimerization of IL2 may provide a mechanism to permit nerve growth under conditions in which oligodendrocytes inhibit neuronal regeneration (Eitan and Schwartz, 1993). </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL2 have been studied in transgenic mice expressing either the human IL2 gene or the TAC IL2 receptor. Transgenic mice harboring the human gene for IL2 or the TAC-IL2 receptor constitutively express IL2 in the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lungs, muscle, and skin. Among other things these animals show pronounced growth retardation and die prematurely. Histologically one observes a selective loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and a focal infiltration of lymphocytes, leading to pneumonia. The spleen shows a massive increase of cells with the marker spectrum thy1(+) CD3(-) CD4(-) CD8(-). The expression of the human IL2 gene which has been transferred into murine T-cells by means of a retrovirus vector leads to growth autonomy and malignant transformation of the cells. </p>
<p>Transgenic mice expressing murine IL2 constitutively in islet beta-cells die at an early age because of a predominant macrophage inflammatory response that destroys the exocrine pancreas. Animals with lower levels of IL2 survive and have islets that become increasingly infiltrated with lymphocytes over time without, however, developing autoimmunity to islet antigens. </p>
<p>The requirement for IL2 has been tested in vivo, using knock-out mice generated by targeted recombination in ES cells to inhibit IL2 gene functions. Mice homozygous for the IL2 gene mutation are normal with regard to the subset composition of thymocytes and peripheral T-cells during the first 3-4 weeks of age. However, a dysregulation of the immune system is manifested by reduced polyclonal in vitro responses of T-cells and by dramatic changes in the isotype levels of serum immunoglobulins. IL2 deficient mice have been shown to develop an unlimited inflammatory bowel disease later in life (past 6 weeks of age) with striking clinical and histological similarity to ulcerative colitis in humans. </p>
<p>IL2 deficient mice have been analyzed also with respect to immune responses in vivo. responses of primary and secondary cytotoxic T-cells against vaccinia and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus have been found to be within normal ranges. T-helper cell responses are delayed but biologically functional. Natural killer cell activities are markedly reduced but inducible. B-cells reactivity to vesicular stomatitis virus is not impaired. These observations suggest that other factors may compensate for the IL2 defects in vivo. IL2 deficient mice have high levels of IgG1 and IgE isotypes in their sera. This was taken as evidence that IL4 was involved probably in immunoglobulin class switching and compensated, at least in part, for the IL2 deficiency. The recent generation of double-negative mice not expressing IL2 and IL4 shows, however, that these also have normal major T-cell subsets and B-cells, indicating that both Interleukins are not essential for development of the immune system. It was even observed that IL2/IL4 double negative mice displayed higher levels of T-cell proliferation. </p>
<p>The functions of IL2-producing cells have been studied also by creating transgenic mice in which IL2-producing cells, rendered sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the antiviral drug gancyclovir, can be eliminated selectively (cell ablation) at different stages of development. These studies show that some proliferative responses of T-cells to antigens occur via an alternative pathway not requiring IL2 synthesis and release. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL2 can be assayed in bioassays employing cell lines that respond to the factor (see: A9.12, ATH8; CT6; CTLL-2; FDCPmix; HT-2; NKC3; TALL-103). Specific ELISA assays for IL2 and enzyme immunoassays for the soluble receptor are also available. The soluble receptor can be detected also by employing biotinylated IL2 and flow-through cytometry or ELISA assays. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For IL2 units see also: BRMP unit. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL2 displays significant anti-tumor activity for a variety of tumor cell types since it supports the proliferation and clonal expansion of T-cells that specifically attack certain tumor types (see: Adoptive immunotherapy, LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells) and TIL cells (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) for clinical applications). IL2 is increasingly used to treat patients with cancers refractory to conventional treatment. Combination therapy with systemically administered IL2 has resulted in long-term remissions in 30 % of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, for which there is no standard treatment. Objective and long-lived clinical responses have been documented also in a proportion of patients with melanoma or acute myeloid leukemia. </p>
<p>In spite of the stimulation of a range of host antitumor defense mechanisms, only 30-40 % of patients who are treated respond to IL2 therapy as assessed by a reduction in tumor volume. More randomized clinical trials are required to evaluate precisely the role of IL2 in various therapeutic combinations and to ascertain the optimum therapeutic regimens for individual tumor types. The therapeutic results obtained in humans have been less beneficial and more selective than those in experimental animals and more basic research is required to ascertain how IL2 produces its antitumor effects. </p>
<p>A study with 15 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma prior to and during treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of IL2 suggests that measurement of serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) may permit to distinguish those cancer patients who are most likely to respond to and benefit from IL2 therapy. </p>
<p>One of the reasons may be that IL2 has been used more or less as a chemotherapeutic compound in the highest tolerable dose, which mainly stimulates nonspecific LAK cells activity through low affinity IL2 receptors without leading to systemic immunity. High dose IL2 therapy, accordingly, is also associated with a great number of unwanted toxic side-effects. IL2 has additional effects on other components of the cellular immune system, including B-cells and macrophages, and induces the secretion of other soluble mediators, including TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and IFN-gamma. These effects may contribute to the antitumor activity of IL2 as well as to its dose-related toxicity. </p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the application of intratumoral low doses of IL2 can be highly effective against cancer and without toxic side-effects. IL2-toxin protein chimeras are currently under investigation in the treatment of cancer (see: Cytokine fusion toxins). </p>
<p>Protocols are now under intense study to elevate the immunogenicity of tumors by the introduction of a functional IL2 gene (see also: Cytokine gene transfer). It is hoped that the enhanced expression and secretion of IL2 by tumor cells engineered by means of this sophisticated technology will lead to the activation of T-cells and thus provide a modality for the treatment of these tumors and their metastases. The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL2 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts. Altered tumor cells expressing IL2 also increase systemic immunity. </p>
<p>Cellular immunodeficiency diseases, especially those with impaired IL2 production are successfully treated by daily injections of hIL2. IL2 is also effective on some patients with antibody deficiency, probably caused by the lack of T-cell help for B-cells. </p>
<p>A number of diseases have been described to be associated with the aberrant expression of IL2 or IL2 receptors, including Hodgkin's disease, Graft-versus-Host reaction, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, type 1 diabetes, lepromatous leprosy, AIDS, immunodeficiency syndrome, severe burn traumas (see also: inflammation, wound healing), and allogenic bone marrow transplantation. </p>
<p>Fusion proteins consisting of IL2 and the weakly immunogenic Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) glycoprotein D have been constructed. They have been reported to enhance both humoral and cellular immunity against HSV-1 and to protect mice immunized with the fusion protein against HSC-1 infections. For other fusion proteins converting weakly immunogenic antigens into potent immunogens see: GM-CSF (subentry CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE). </p>
