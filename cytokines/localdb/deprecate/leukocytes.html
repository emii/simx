<h1>leukocytes</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>a general collective term for some cell types of the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis). Leukocytes are those cells that do not produce hemoglobin (white blood cells). Normal human blood contains 4000 - 10,000 leukocytes/mL. </p>
<p>Individual types of leukocytes are differentiated from each other by morphology and behaviour towards histochemical stains. Leukocytes are generally divided into granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear cells) and agranulocytes (monomorphonuclear leukocytes, mononuclear cells). Granulocytes comprise basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Agranulocytes comprise monocytes and macrophages and lymphocytes (B-cells and T-cells). For a collective term see also: wandering cells. </p>
<p>40 - 75 % of blood leukocytes are neutrophils, 1 - 6 % are eosinophils, 2 - 10 % are monocytes, 20 - 45 % are lymphocytes, less than 1% are basophils. A subpopulation of leukocytes expressing markers of dendritic cells and endothelial cells, has been described as vascular leukocytes. </p>
<p>Some of the cellular contents may be shed by microvesiculation in the form of microparticles. </p>
