<p> </p>
<p> Commonly used abbreviations: </p>
<p>BAEC [bovine aortic endothelial cells] BEC [blood endothelial cells] BMEC [bone marrow endothelial cells] CEC [Circulating endothelial cells] CMEC [cardiac microvascular endothelial cells] EC [Endothelial cells] HAEC [human aorta endothelial cells] HBMEC [human brain microvascular endothelial cells] HDMEC [human dermal microvascular endothelial cells] HIMEC [human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells] HMEC [human microvascular endothelial cells] HSEC [hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells] HSVEC [human saphenous vein endothelial cells] HUVEC [human umbilical vein endothelial cells] LEC [lymphatic endothelial cells] MEC [microvessel endothelial cells; microvascular endothelial cells] MVEC [microvascular endothelial cells] PAEC [pulmonary artery endothelial cells] RCEC [retinal capillary endothelial cells] RMEC [retinal microvascular endothelial cells] VEC [vascular endothelial cells] </p>
<p> Endothelial cells are oblong shaped cells that line the lumen of all blood vessels as a single squamous epithelial cell layer. They are derived from angioblasts and hemangioblasts. The term endotheliocytes may be used synonymously. For a cell type coexpressing myogenic cell and endothelial cell markers see: myoendothelial cells. Endothelial cells have been shown also to constitute an instructive and inductive vascular niche for the self-renewal and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, tumor growth, and liver regeneration (see: angiocrine factors).  </p>
<p>Endothelial cell spheroids are aggregates of endothelial cells formed when these cells are grown under suitable conditions in suspension cultures. These spheroids usually consist of a surface monolayer of differentiated cells and a center of unorganized cells that will die by apoptosis if they are not rescued by survival factors (Oudar, 2000; Korff and Augustin, 1998). Such spheroids have been used to assay the activities of angiogenesis factors and their inhibitors (spheroidal angiogenesis assay). </p>
<p>Weibel-Palade bodies are specialized secretory granules found in endothelial cells. These vesicles store preformed hormones, cytokines, and growth factors, as well as enzymes, receptors, and adhesion molecules, which can be released and/or expressed on the cell surface without de novo protein syntheses by regulated exocytosis in response to stimulation of cell activation of cells (Hannah et al, 2002; Michaux and Cutler DF, 2004; van Mourik et al, 2002). </p>
<p>In small capillaries endothelial cells may be the only cell type present, and in some cases (large vessels of invertebrates, an endothelial cell layer is missing (Risau, 1995; Dejana et al, 1995; Munoz-Chapuli et al 2005). These cells play a major role in vascular biology under normal or pathological conditions (Wiel et al, 2005), including the control of blood pressure (vasoconstriction and vasodilation) (Cosentino and Volpe, 2005), blood clotting (thrombosis, fibrinolysis) (Wiel et al, 2005; Chen and Lopez, 2005), formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) (Gerhardt and Betsholtz, 2005; Szekanecz and Koch, 2005), leukocyte adhesion/trafficking and inflammatory processes (Cook-Mills and Deem, 2005; Aird, 2005; Szekanecz and Koch, 2005). </p>
<p>Raised numbers of so-called circulating endothelial cells (abbr. CECs) in the peripheral blood are present in a wide variety of pathophysiological conditions. Their presence can be taken as a marker of endothelial damage in a variety of vascular disorders. These cells are often defined by the expression of membrane glycoprotein CD146 and can be associated with, and contribute to, inflammatory, immune, infectious, neoplastic and cardiovascular diseases (Blann et al, 2005; Dignat-George et al, 2003; Khan et al, 2005; Hunting et al, 2005). Immature circulating endothelial cells derived from the bone marrow are being referred to as endothelial progenitor cells (see: angioblasts) (Khan et al, 2005). </p>
<p>Endothelial cells are quite heterogeneous with respect to their functional capacities and cell morphology and play distinct roles in different vessels, tissues, and organs (Gebb and Stevens, 2004; Conway and Carmeliet, 2004). </p>
<p>Specialized endothelial cells present at the leading edge of vascular sprouts, integrate directional cues from their environment to define the direction in which the new sprouts grow and also generate functional vascular networks by connecting with adjacent sprouts during angiogenesis (tip cells; see: tip endothelial cells). For another specialized endothelial cell type involved in sprouting angiogenesis see also: stalk cells; for a phenotype that reduces tumor metastasis see also: phalanx cells. The tumor vasculature contains so-called suppressor endothelial cells, which appear to be skewed by tumor cells towards disrupting functions of NK-cells, T-cells, and macrophages, and thus are involved in tumor-induced immune suppression. </p>
<p>Endothelial cells from large vessels participate in the control of vascular tone and blood pressure. Endothelial cells in capillaries participate in the exchange of gas and metabolic products and also permit extravasation of immune cells during infection and differ in the degree of permeability. Extravasation of mature lymphocytes circulating from blood to lymph takes place in high endothelial venules found in lymphatic organs. The corresponding endothelial cells have a characteristic morphology and express a number of selectins, integrins, and other adhesion molecules participating in regulating cell traffic. </p>
<p> Endothelial cells have been shown to express a plethora of factors (for a role of endothelial cells as an organ system see also: angiocrine factors). Differences in gene expression between microvascular and human umbilical vein endothelial cells have been identified. Endothelial cells from arteries and veins also differ in their gene expression patterns. Nelson et al (2007) have compared expression profiles of blood vascular endothelial cells (BEC) and the developmentally related lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). Both cell types create complementary but distinct vascular networks and also show different phenotypes and expression profiles. </p>
<p>Tumor endothelial cells also differ from normal endothelial cells morphologically and by their expression and distribution of specific markers (see, for example: Charalambous et al, 2005). Clasper et al (2008) have shown that the expression profiles of primary lymphatic endothelial cells differ from those isolated from the vasculature of tumor tissues. The nature of the substratum, i.e., artificial basement membrane or fibrillar type I collagen may also influence expression. In additon, factor such as shear stress have been shown to have a profound effect on gene expression (Brooks et al, 2002; Wasserman et al, 2002; Chen et al, 2001). Gerritsen et al (2003) have used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to study changes in gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with HGF, VEGF, or the combination of the two. They have shown that among approximately 22000 genes studied, genes significantly upregulated and downregulated by VEGF versus HGF exhibit very little overlap, indicating distinct signal transduction pathways. Distinct changes are seen also when the cells are treated with a combination of the two growth factors acting in synergy. </p>
<p> Endothelial cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
