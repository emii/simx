<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL4 is produced mainly by a subpopulation of activated T-cells (Th2) which are the biologically most active helper cells for B-cells and which also secrete IL5 and IL6. Another subpopulation (Th1) also produces IL4 albeit to a lesser extent. Non-T/Non-B-cells of the lineage of mast cells also produce IL4. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL4 is a protein of 129 amino acids (20 kDa) that is synthesized as a precursor containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 24 amino acids. IL4 is glycosylated at two arginine residues (positions 38 and 105) and contains six cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation. The disulfide bonds are essential for biological activity. Some glycosylation variants of IL4 have been described that differ in their biological activities. A comparison of murine and human IL4 shows that both proteins only diverge at positions 91-128. </p>
<p>An IL4 variant, Y124D, in which Tyr124 of the recombinant human protein (see also: Recombinant cytokines) is substituted by an aspartic acid residue, binds with high affinity to the IL4 receptor (KD = 310 pM). This variant is a powerful antagonist for the IL4 receptor system. It retains no detectable proliferative activity for T-cells and competitively inhibits IL4 dependent T-cell proliferation (K(i) = 620 pM) (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). The existence of this mutant demonstrates that high affinity binding and signal generation can be uncoupled efficiently in a ligand. Y124D also acts as a powerful antagonist for the IL13 receptor. A naturally occurring alternative splice variant of IL4, designated IL4-delta-2, lacks Exon 2 sequences and has been found to act as a naturally occurring antagonist of IL4 actions. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL4 gene contains four exons and has a length of approximately 10 kb. It maps to chromosome 5q23-31 (see also: 5q minus syndrome). The murine gene maps to chromosome 11. The IL4 gene is in close proximity to other genes encoding hematopoietic growth factors (see: GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL3, IL5). The distance between the IL4 and the IL5 gene is approximately 90-240 kb. </p>
<p>At the nucleotide level the human and the murine IL4 gene display approximately 70 % homology. The 5' region of the IL4 contains several sequence elements, designated CLE (conserved lymphokine element), that are binding sites for transcription factors controlling the expression of this and other genes (see also: gene expression). A sequence motif, called P sequence (CGAAAATTTCC) in the 5' region of the human IL4 gene (positions -79 - -69) is the binding site for a nuclear factor, called NF(P), mediating the response to T-cell activation signals (see also: cell activation). </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL4 are mediated by a specific receptor (Kdis = 20-100 pM) which is expressed at densities of 100-5000 copies/cell. The extracellular domain of the IL4 receptor is related to the receptors for Epo, IL6, and the beta chain of the IL2 receptor. It has been given the name CD124. </p>
<p>Two types of IL4 receptor (IL4R) exist: the type 1 receptor is a heterodimer consisting of CD132 and IL4R-alpha. The type 2 receptor is a heterodimer consisting of IL4R-alpha and IL13R-alpha-1. </p>
<p>The cDNA for the murine IL4 receptor encodes a transmembrane protein of 810 amino acids (including a secretory signal sequence). This receptor has a large intracellular domain of 553 amino acids. The human receptor has an extracellular domain of 207 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 24 residues, and a large intracellular domain of 569 amino acids. </p>
<p>The IL4 receptor has been shown recently to contain the gamma subunit of the IL2 receptor as a signaling component. This gamma subunit is also associated with the receptors for IL4 and IL7 and probably also of IL13. These findings can explain the severity of the immune defect in X-linked immunodeficiency. </p>
<p>Two forms of the receptor have been described, one of which is secreted. The secreted receptor only contains the extracellular IL4 binding domain and is capable of blocking IL4 activities. An IL4 binding protein (IL4BP) that binds IL4 with the same affinity as the IL4 receptor has been shown also to be a soluble IL4 receptor variant. These soluble receptors probably function as physiological regulators of cytokine activities (see also: Cytokine inhibitors) by inhibiting receptor binding or act as transport proteins. Indeed, studies with transgenic animals constitutively expressing elevated levels of a soluble IL4 receptor have shown that, despite an almost normal development, these animals show a markedly delayed rejection of allografts, suggesting a critical role of IL4 in alloreactivity. </p>
<p>In experimental animals the soluble IL4 receptor can block IgE secretion by neutralizing endogenous IL4. It can also enhance, in a dose-dependent manner, the biologic effects of exogenously administered IL4, presumably by altering the biodistribution of the cytokine. </p>
<p>Soluble receptors or binding proteins have been described also for IL1 (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), IL2, IL6, IL7, TNF-alpha, IGF, and IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>The mechanisms of IL4 mediated intracellular signal transduction are largely unknown. IL4 influences intracellular calcium levels (see also: Calcium ionophore) and also the metabolism of inositol phospholipids and protein kinase C. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL4 are species-specific; mouse IL4 is inactive on human cells and human IL4 is inactive on murine cells. </p>
<p>IL4 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of activated B-cells (see also: CD40), the expression of MHC class 2 antigens, and of low affinity IgE receptors (see: CD23) in resting B-cells. IL4 is probably an autocrine growth modulator for Hodgkin's lymphomas (see also: HCGF, Hodgkin's cell growth factor). </p>
<p>IL4 enhances expression of MHC class 2 antigens on B-cells. It can promote their capacity to respond to other B-cell stimuli and to present antigens for T-cells. This may be one way to promote the clonal expansion of specific B-cells and the immune system may thus be able to respond to very low concentrations of antigens. The production of IL4 by Non-B Non-T-cells is stimulated if these cells interact with other cells via their Fc receptors for IgE or IgG. This effect can be enhanced by IL3. </p>
<p>IL2 and PAF (platelet activating factor) induce the synthesis of IL4 while TGF-beta inhibits it. </p>
<p>IL4 inhibits cell activation of NK-cells induced by IL2. IL4 stimulates the proliferation of thymocytes with the marker spectrum CD4(-) CD8(-), CD4(+) CD8(-), CD4(-) CD8(+). In CD4(+) cells IL4 induces the expression of CD8. </p>
<p>IL3 antagonizes the IL2 induced effects in B-cells and causes a slow decrease of the expression of IL2 receptors, thus inhibiting the proliferation of human B-cells stimulated by IL2. In activated B-cells IL4 stimulates the synthesis of IgG1 and IgE and inhibits the synthesis of IgM, IgG3, IgG2a and IgG2b. This Isotype switching induced by IL4 in B-cells is antagonized by IFN-gamma. The growth of multiple myelomas can be suppressed by IL4 which inhibits the synthesis of IL6, a myeloma growth factor. IL4 also inhibits the synthesis of IL6 in human alveolar macrophages. </p>
<p>Pretreatment of macrophages with IL4 prevents the production of IL1, TNF-alpha and prostaglandins in response to activation of the cells by bacterial endotoxins or IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>IL4 synergises with Epo and G-CSF/Epo in the generation of colonies containing granulocytes or erythroid progenitor cells in a colony formation assay. </p>
<p>Experiments with an oncogene encoding a tyrosine-specific protein kinase show that the expression of the oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinase abolishes IL4 requirements (and also GM-CSF and IL3 requirements) in factor-dependent cells. The exact mechanism by which these factors regulate proliferation and differentiation is still unknown. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of the deregulated expression of IL4 has been studied in transgenic mice overexpressing human IL4 in all tissues. In these animals one observes the excessive production of serum IgE levels. The expression of the IL4 transgene in the thymus interferes with T-cell maturation and strongly reduces the population of immature CD4(+) CD8(+) thymocytes and peripheral T-cells while the numbers of mature CD8(+) thymocytes increases excessively. In addition these animals suffer from severe inflammatory blepharitis. The levels of IL4 cannot be increased over a certain level because the uncontrolled overexpression leads to the death of these animals. The introduction of a recombinant IL4 gene (see also: Recombinant cytokines) and the resulting overproduction of IL4 leads to factor-independence in IL4 dependent cells although it does not cause cell transformation. </p>
<p>Several cytokine mRNA such as those coding for IL5, IL6, IFN-gamma and also the IL4 receptor are found to be upregulated in IL4-transgenic mice, whereas IL1, IL2, IL3, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta mRNA levels do not seem to be influenced by IL4. </p>
<p>The expression of IL4 in transgenic mice has profound effects on B-cell function. B-cells from these animals have an increased size and show elevated expression of MHC class 2. The animals show elevated serum levels of IgG1 and IgE and decreased levels of IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3. Antigen-specific antibody responses to immunization with hapten-carrier conjugates are also affected by IL4. Treatment of IL4-transgenic mice with IL4-specific monoclonal antibodies reverses many of the isotype alterations, indicating that they arise as a direct consequence of IL4 secretion. </p>
<p>IL4-transgenic mice established from 129/Sc mice that are genetically resistant to infection with Leishmania major have been shown to be susceptible to Leishmania infections, thus demonstrating that Th2 T-helper cell-derived IL4 promotes disease development in cutaneous Leishmaniasis. </p>
<p>Transgenic mice overexpressing IL4 under the control of lymphocyte-specific regulatory sequences derived from the lck gene have been shown to develop osteopetrosis as the result of markedly decreased bone formation by osteoblasts. </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL4 have been studied also in IL4 deficient knock-out mice generated by targeted disruption of the IL4 gene in embryonic stem cells (see: ES cells). Thymus and T-cell subsets develop normally. IL4 appears to play an important role in the establishment of a functional Th2 immune response. CD4(+) T-cells from naive IL4 deficient mice fail to produce Th2 cytokines after in vitro stimulation. The levels of Th2 cytokines IL5, IL9, and IL10 from CD4(+) T-cells obtained after infection of these mice with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis are significantly reduced. IL4 deficient mice have been shown also to be resistant to retrovirus induced immunodeficiency syndrome. Double mutant mice, deficient in IL4 and IL2 have been shown to be viable and to have normal major T-cell subsets and B-cells, indicating that neither IL2 nor IL4 are essential for development of the immune system. IL4 deficient mice have been shown also to develop resistance against retrovirus induced immunodeficiency (MAIDS), displaying no lethalities and delayed development of T-cell abnormalities usually associated with MAIDS. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>The classical detection method for IL4 is a B-cell costimulation assay measuring the enhanced proliferation of stimulated purified B-cells. IL4 can be detected also in bioassays, employing IL4-responsive cells (see: BALM-4; BCL1; CCL-185; CT.4S; CTL44; CTLL-2; Da; FDCPmix; HT-2; L4; L138.8A; MO7E; MC/9; NFS-60; Ramos, Sez627, TF-1; TS1). A specific detection method for human IL4 is the induction of CD23 in a number of B-cell lines with CD23 detected either by flow-through cytometry or by a fluorescence immunoassay. For an immunoassay allowing rapid determination of the rate of IL4 production under conditions preventing consumption/degradation see also: Cytokine immunotrapping. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL4 may be of clinical importance in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases since it inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL1, IL6 and TNF-alpha by monocytes and of TNF by T-cells (see also: inflammation). IL4 may be useful also in the treatment of solid tumors, of hematopoietic systemic diseases, and of immune defects. IL4 inhibits the growth of colon and mammary carcinomas. It has been shown to augment the development of lymphokine-activated killer cells (see: LAK cells). </p>
<p>IL4 may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia disease, which is characterized by the accumulation of slow-dividing and long-lived monoclonal B-cells arrested at the intermediate stage of their differentiation. by preventing both the death and the proliferation of the malignant B-cells. It protects chronic lymphocytic leukemic B-cells from death by apoptosis and upregulates the expression of a protective gene, BCL2. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL4 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts. Altered tumor cells expressing IL4 also increase systemic immunity. Mice vaccinated with transduced cells reject a subsequent challenge of non-transduced cells, and, in some cases, a pre-existing tumor (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
