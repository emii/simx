<h1>CD4</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>This cell surface antigen is known also as T4, Leu3, OKT4 or L3T4 (murine), Ly4 (murine), or W3/25 and OX38 or OX35 (rat). CD4 is a 55 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In humans CD4 is expressed of peripheral T-cells, thymocytes, on macrophages and granulocytes. It is expressed also in a developmentally regulated manner in specific regions of the brain. The human CD4 gene is on chromosome 12pter-p12. </p>
<p>Progenitors T-cells in the thymus initially do not express CD4 and another antigen called CD8 and develop into mature T-cells in several steps. CD4(+) cells are T-helper cells that, upon cell activation, produce a number of different cytokines and play a role in the activation and/or proliferation of B-cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. </p>
<p> FACS analysis of thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes This graphic shows the results obtained by analyzing fluorescence intensity of thymocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes labelled with fluorescent antibodies directed against CD4 or CD8. Populations of thymocytes contain double-negative (yellow) and double-positive (light blue) cell types while peripheral blood lymphocytes contain no double-positive cells but only single positive or double-negative cells. Arrows indicate increasing fluorescence intensity (log10 fluorescence). </p>
<p> CD4 acts as a cellular adhesion molecule binding MHC class 2 molecules. It stabilizes the interaction of MHC class 2 restricted T-cells and antigen-presenting cells expressing an antigen in combination with a MHC class 2 molecule. Interactions of CD4 with MHC class 2 molecules are crucial during thymic development and subsequently for the function of single-positive CD4(+) CD8(-) T-lymphocytes (see also XLCM). </p>
<p>CD4 also acts as a receptor for HIV but requires cosignals (see also: CCR5). Another ligand of CD4 is LCF (lymphocyte chemoattractant factor). The expression of CD4 in brain suggest that it may play a more general role in mediating cell recognition events than merely those of cellular immune responses. </p>
<p>Thymocytes, which are CD4(+) and CD8(-) produce factors such as IL4, IL5, IL10 and IFN-gamma (see also: T-helper). </p>
<p>CD4 functions as an effector molecule for intracellular signal transduction. In T-lymphocytes CD4 has been found to be associated with tyrosine kinase lck which phosphorylates a number of other cell surface proteins (including CD3) and is involved probably in transducing the intracellular signal when these proteins are bound to their receptors (see also: HT-2 cell line). </p>
<p>Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 inhibit several cellular functions in vitro and have been used, among other things, to treat autoimmune diseases in experimental animals. At present, these antibodies, and also antibody-toxin chimeras are tested as drugs against infections with HIV. One particular class of genetically engineered proteins, known as immunoadhesins, are fusion proteins combining the constant Fc region of IgG with the CD4 receptor domain acting as a binding site for pg120 protein of HIV. Such fusion proteins therefore contain an additional functional constant region of the IgG antibody and can be used to eliminate cells and viruses expressing the corresponding antigens. </p>
<p>Pluripotent murine hematopoietic stem cells have been shown also to express the CD4 antigen. The CD4(+) cells isolated from mouse marrow repopulate all hematopoietic lineages in several assays (see: BMC, bone marrow culture; MRA, marrow repopulating ability), indicating that this population contains primitive stem cells with extensive repopulation capacity. This also suggests that CD4 may play an important role also in lineage definition in early hematopoietic differentiation (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The expression of IL4 in transgenic animals blocks the maturation of T-cells and considerably reduces the population of immature CD4(+) CD8(+) thymocytes and peripheral T-cells while at the same time greatly enhancing the numbers of CD8(+) mature thymocytes. </p>
<p>In CD4(-) knock-out mouse strains the development of CD8(+) cells proceeds normally although the activity of helper cells is greatly reduced. The proliferation of thymocytes with the marker spectrum [(CD4(-) CD8(-)], [(CD4(+) CD8(-)], [CD4(-) CD8(+)] is stimulated by IL7 which is therefore an important developmental factor for functionally different subpopulations of T-lymphocytes. </p>
