<p>Epithelial cells are cells that line the inner and outer surfaces of the body in continuous sheets (epithelial membranes, usually referred to as epithelia). Epithelial tissues can develop from ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. </p>
<p>Epithelial cells are joined together by cell junctions (tight junctions found only in epithelia, but also adhering junctions and gap junctions, which are found also in other tissues). The epithelial cell layer is attached to the underlying connective tissue by a basement membrane, which is secreted in part by the epithelial cells and the underlying connective tissue cells. </p>
<p>Epithelia do not contain blood vessels and are supplied with nutrients and oxygen by blood vessels in the connective tissue beneath the basement membrane. </p>
<p>The main functions of epithelia are protection (e. g., skin), absorption (e. g., lining of the intestines), and secretion (e. g., lining of the stomach wall). Epithelial exocrine or endocrine glands develop when epithelial cell sheets invaginate into underlying connective tissue and differentiate into cells with secretory functions. </p>
<p>Epithelial cells are classified normally by shape, by the number of cell laters they form, and by their specialization. Squamous epithelial cells are thin and have an irregular flattened shape. They usually occur in simple layers (examples: endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and lymph channels or mesothelium of body cavities). Cuboidal epithelial cells are cube-shaped and usually have their nucleus in the center (the collecting tubules of the kidney consists of single layers of cuboidal epithelial cells). Columnar epithelial cells are longer than wide and the nucleus is usually near the base of the cell. These cells have tiny hairlike projections, called microvilli, which increase the surface area of the cells. Simple epithelia consist of a single layer of cells. Stratified epithelia consist of more than one layer of cells. The cells in the deep cell layer of the multilayered stratified epithelium that lie directly on top of the basal membrane or nearest to it are referred to as basal cells. These cells can regenerate epithelial cells in the more apical layers and have the ability to differentiate into other cell types of the epithelium. </p>
