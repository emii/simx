    <h2>IL12</h2>
    
<p>Interleukin-12. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>CLMF (cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor); NKSF (natural killer cell stimulatory factor); TcMF (CTL maturation factor; see: CLMF); TSF (T-cell stimulating factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL12 is secreted by peripheral lymphocytes after induction.IL12 is produced by activated hematopoietic phagocytic cells (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and by dendritic cells (Hsieh et al, 1993; Chan CW et al, 2006), but also by a variety of other cell types. The most powerful inducers of IL12 are bacteria, bacterial products, and parasites. IL12 is produced after stimulation with Phorbol esters or Calcium ionophore by human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The human lymphoblastoid cell line NC37 secretes large amounts of the uncomplexed 40 kDa subunit of IL12. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL12 is a heterodimeric 70 kDa glycoprotein (IL12-p70) consisting of a 40 kDa subunit (designated IL12B, IL12-beta, IL12-p40; 40 kDa subunit, 306 amino acids; 10 % carbohydrate) and a 35 kDa subunit (designated IL12A, IL12-alpha, IL12-p35; p35, 197 amino acids; 20 % carbohydrate) linked by disulfide bonds that are essential for the biological activity of IL12. IL12-p40 contains 10 cysteines and a binding site for heparin (see also: HBGF, heparin binding growth factors); p35 contains 7 cysteines. </p>
<p>p40 shows some homology with the extracellular domain of the receptor for IL6. p35 and IL6 probably are homologous. p40 has been shown to be a subunit of another composite cytokine, designated IL23. The p40 subunit can also form a homodimer, IL12-p80, which act as an IL12 and IL23 antagonist by competing at their receptors. </p>
<p>Lieschke et al (1997) have recently described the construction of bioactive murine and human IL12 fusion proteins combining the two IL12 subunits in a single molecule. This designer cytokine (see also: Muteins) retains antitumor activity in vivo. Anderson et al (1997) have described the construction of Flexi 12, a single chain protein retaining all of the biological characteristics of the dimeric recombinant IL12. </p>
<p>The p35 subunit of IL12 has been shown to heterodimerize with a protein known as EBI-3 (EBV induced gene-3). p28 is related to the p35 subunit of IL12 and is one subunit of the IL27 heterodimeric protein. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding the p40 subunit of IL12 (IL12B; see also: IL12-p40) maps to human chromosome 5q31-q33 in the same region that also harbors other cytokine genes (see: 5q minus syndrome). The gene encoding the p35 subunit of IL12 (IL12A; see also: IL12-p35) maps to human chromosome 3p12-q13.2. The expression of the two genes is regulated independently of each other </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL12 receptor (CD212) appears to be a single protein of approximately 110 kDa. Up to 1000-9000 high affinity IL12 receptors/cell are expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by various mitogens for T-cells or by IL2. IL12 receptors are present on activated T-cells expressing CD4 and CD8 and on activated CD56(+) natural killer cells. Resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tonsillar B-cells, or tonsillar B-cells activated by anti-IgM/Dx, anti-IgM/Dx + IL2, or SAC + IL2 do not express the receptor. High affinity IL12 receptors are expressed constitutively on a transformed marmoset NK-like cell line, HVS.SILVA 40. </p>
<p>Binding of IL12 to its receptor can be prevented by monoclonal antibodies directed against the p40 subunit which therefore contains the binding site. The p40 subunit of IL12 shows homology with the extracellular domain of the IL6 receptor. For a virus-encoded homolog of the p40 subunit see also: (EBI-3: EBV induced gene-3). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL12 is not active in murine lymphocytes. Hybrid heterodimers consisting of murine p35 and human p40 subunits retain bioactivity on murine cells; however, the combination of human p35 and murine p40 is completely inactive on murine cells. Murine IL12 is active on both murine and human lymphocytes. </p>
<p>The p40 subunit of murine IL12 subunit p40 (IL12-p40) has been shown to specifically antagonize the effects of the IL12 heterodimer in different assay systems and to function as an endogenous specific inhibitor for the IL12 heterodimer (Mattner et al, 1993). Some cells, such as microglia and macrfophages, have been shown to produce the IL12-p40 subunit, but not IL12, under certain conditions (Constantinescu et al, 1996; Mottonen et al, 2002; Fernandez-Lago et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL12 stimulates the proliferation of human lymphoblasts following cell activation by phytohemagglutinin. IL12 activates CD56(+) NK-cells, and this activity is blocked by antibodies specific for TNF-alpha. IL12 promotes specific allogenic CTL reactions. IL12 synergizes also with anti-CD3 antibodies and with allogeneic stimulation in mixed lymphocyte cultures in inducing T-cell proliferation. </p>
<p>In peripheral lymphocytes of the Th1 T-helper cell type IL12 induces the synthesis of IFN-gamma and IL2, and TNF. TNF-alpha also appears to be involved in mediating the effects of IL12 on natural killer cells since the effects of IL12 are inhibited by an antibody directed against TNF-alpha. IL12 and TNF-alpha are costimulators for IFN-gamma production with IL12 maximizing the IFN-gamma response; the production of IL12, TNF, and IFN-gamma is inhibited by IL10. In Th2 T-helper cells IL12 reduces the synthesis of IL4, IL5, and IL10. </p>
<p>IL12 synergises with suboptimal amounts of IL2 in promoting the proliferation of mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood and in promoting the generation of LAK cells (lymphokine activated killer cells). Picomolar concentrations of IL12 are as effective as nanomolar concentrations of IL2 in augmenting the cytolytic activity of natural killer cells expanded in vivo by IL2. IL12 also acts as a co-mitogen and potentiates the proliferation of resting peripheral cells induced by IL2. </p>
<p>IL12 is involved probably also in the selection of immunoglobulin isotypes. At picomolar concentrations IL12 markedly inhibits the synthesis of IgE by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with IL4 also in the presence of antibodies directed against IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Murine IL12 has been shown to alter CD4(+) subset differentiation and to be involved in the induction of protective immunity against intracellular parasitic infections in mice. It cures mice infected with Leishmania major. </p>
<p>IL12 enhances myelopoiesis of primitive bone marrow progenitor cells induced by SCF (stem cell factor) and synergizes with colony stimulating factors (see: CSF) to induce proliferation. IL12 also has synergistic effects on more committed bone marrow progenitors, synergising with IL3, IL11, or IL3 plus SCF. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of IL12 deficiency have been studied in transgenic knock-out mice generated from ES cells. IL12 deficient mice are impaired but not completely lacking in the ability to produce IFN-gamma following endotoxin administration and to mount a Th1 T-helper cell response in vivo. Secretion of IL4 is enhanced, while proliferation and secretion of IL2 and IL10 are normal following antigen stimulation. Delayed type hypersensitivity responses in mutant mice are significantly reduced while the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is not compromised in the absence of IL12. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL12 is of potential clinical interest since it allows to reduce doses of IL2 required for the generation of LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells). This may reduce the toxicity of higher doses of IL2 used for Adoptive immunotherapy. IL12 may be useful in expanding an antigen-specific T-cell population, as the culture of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with IL12 and low-dose IL2 leads to proliferation only in response to an antigen co-signal. IL12 has been shown to augment natural killer-cell mediated cytotoxicity in a number of conditions, including patients with hairy cell leukemia. </p>
<p>The ability of IL12 to induce the synthesis of IFN-gamma and to stimulate the proliferation of resting peripheral cells may be of interest also. </p>
<p>IL12 has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of experimental tumors in vivo and to have anti-angiogenic effects in vivo, which are, at least in part, mediated by IFN-gamma. IL12 therefore seems to be a potential candidate also for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent malignancies. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL12 can be assayed by its activity as NKSF (natural killer cell stimulatory factor) or CLMF (cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor). Human and porcine IL12 can be assayed in 10B10 cells. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. Murine IL12 can be measured in bioassays using the 2D6 cell line. </p>
