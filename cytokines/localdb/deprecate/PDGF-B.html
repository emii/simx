    <h2>PDGF</h2>
    
<p>[platelet-derived growth factor] </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>FDGF (fibroblast-derived growth factor); GDGF (glioma-derived growth factor); GDGF-1 (glioma-derived growth factor = PDGF-AA homodimer); GDGF-2 (glioma-derived growth factor = PDGF-AB heterodimer); GSM (Glucocorticoid-suppressible mitogenic activity = PDGF-AA homodimer); MDF (mesangial cell proliferating factor); MDGF (monocyte-derived growth factor); OBIF [osteoblastogenesis inhibitory factor] (= PDGF-BB) ODGF (osteosarcoma-derived growth factor); T47D factor. PDGF is the major component of MDF and MDGF. Some of the MDGF activity may be due to fibroblast growth factors (see: FGF). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>PDGF is synthesized mainly by megakaryocytes. It is stored in the alpha granules of platelets from which it is released after cell activation of platelets for example by thrombin. </p>
<p>A plethora of other cell types also synthesize PDGF including macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, glial cells, astrocytes, myoblasts, smooth muscle cells, and a number of tumor cell lines. In vivo PDGF is synthesized by man cells as a protein consisting of one of the two PDGF chains. Platelets synthesize a mixture of the three possible isoforms (70 % AB, 20 % BB, 10 % AA) while fibroblasts stimulated with EGF synthesize AA homodimers. Activated macrophages and placental cytotrophoblasts produce the BB homodimer. </p>
<p>The synthesis of PDGF can be induced by IL1, IL6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and EGF. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>PDGF is a heat-stable positively charged (pI = 9.8-10) hydrophilic protein of 30 kDa. It consists of two related peptide chains, PDGF-A or PDGF-1 (16 kDa, 124 amino acids), and PDGF-B or PDGF-2 (14 kDa, 140 amino acids) that contain intramolecular disulfide bonds. The subunits are linked by disulfide bonds. All possible isoforms, i.e., PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AB are biologically active. </p>
<p>Several variant forms of PDGF-A have been described. They display approximately 60 % homology with PDGF-B. PDGF-B is identical with the gene product of the cellular oncogene sis. The aminoterminal end of PDGF-B is almost identical with p28sis, the transforming oncoprotein of simian sarcoma virus (see: sis). </p>
<p>The three isoforms of PDGF bind to PDGF with different affinities and also differ in their biological activities. </p>
<p>Mutant forms of PDGF have been created. They form wild-type/mutant heterodimers deficient in assembly or processing. Such mutants behave as dominant negative mutants and are useful in investigation of the role of PDGF in normal and pathological conditions. </p>
<p>PDGF-BB, TGF-beta-2 (see: TGF-beta), and NGF share a similar overall topology (see also: Cystine knot growth factor family). </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding PDGF-A has a length of approximately 24 kb and contains at least seven exons. It maps to human chromosome 7p21-p22. The PDGF-A variants arise by differential splicing of the mRNA. </p>
<p>The PDGF-B gene has a length of approximately 24 kb and contains at least seven exons. It maps to human chromosome 22q12.3-q13. 1 in the vicinity of the gene encoding PD-ECGF (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor) at 22q13. </p>
<p>The PDGF genes are evolutionary conserved from mammals to amphibians. Both genes display a similar exon-intron structures and contain long (>  1 kb) 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The activity of both genes is regulated independently of each other in some cell types and co-ordinately in some other cell types. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>PDGF can signal through two related receptors (Claesson-Welsh L et al, 1991), which can form homodimeric and heterodimeric receptor complexes (Heldin CH et al, 1992). Some of the signal transduction processes mediated by PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta are unique and some are also common (Eriksson A et al, 1992).  </p>
<p>The symbol PDGFR [PDGF receptor] has been replaced by PDGFR1 [PDGF receptor-1]. The approved gene symbol for this receptor is PDGFRB [PDGFR-beta; PDGF receptor-beta]. In the nomenclature of CD antigens the receptor is being referred to as CD140b. For a protein with significant sequence similarity to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of PDGFRB see: PRLTS (PDGF-receptor beta-like tumor suppressor). </p>
<p>The cDNA encoding PDGFR1 has been cloned by Gronwald et al (1988). They have shown that PDGFR1 acts as a high affinity receptor specific for the PDGF-BB isoform of PDGF. Claesson-Welsh et al (1988) have shown that this receptor specifically binds the B-chain-containing PDGF molecules.  </p>
<p>A second receptor has been designated PDGFR2 [PDGF receptor-2]. The approved gene symbol is PDGFRA [PDGFR-alpha; PDGF receptor-alpha]. This receptor binds PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB (Matsui et al, 1989). The genomic structure of the PDGFRA gene has been described by Kawagishi et al (1995). In the nomenclature of CD antigens this receptor has been given the designation CD140a. For a naturally occurring mutant of PDGFRA see: Patch.  </p>
<p>Truncated receptor forms that contain only the extracellular domain have been described also. They are secreted and behave as antagonists of PDGF-stimulated processes (Duan et al, 1991). A PDGF-B-derived peptide comprising the sequences between positions 116-121 and 157-163 (ANFLVWEIVRKK) functions as a PDGF antagonist. It competes with PDGF for binding to the alpha and beta receptors and inhibits the dimerisation and autophosphorylation of the receptor (Engstrm U et al, 1992). For a designer binding protein affecting PDGF binding to its receptor see: GFB-111. </p>
<p>The gene encoding PDGFRB maps to human chromosome 5q33.3, flanked proximally by the GM-CSF gene and only 500 bp away from the fms oncogene that functions as a receptor for M-CSF (see also: 5q minus syndrome) (Eccles et al, 1991). The gene encoding PDGFRA maps to human chromosome 4q11-q12 in the same region (approximately 700 kb) as the kit oncogene that is the receptor for SCF (stem cell factor) (Stenman et al, 1989; Roberts et al, 1988; Gronwald et al, 1990; Hsieh C et al, 1991).  </p>
<p>Di Pasquale et al (2003) have shown that both PDGF receptors act as receptors adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV-5).  </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>In contrast to many other cytokines PDGF is not released into the circulation. The biological half-life is less than two minutes after intravenous administration. </p>
<p>PDGF binds to several plasma proteins and also to proteins of the extracellular matrix which facilitates local concentration of the factor. The factor functions as a local autocrine and paracrine growth factor. In the adult organism PDGF is involved in wound healing processes. The aberrant expression of PDGF is observed with vascular proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis. PDGF and PDGF-like factors are autocrine growth factor for meningiomas. </p>
<p>The induction of various forms of PDGF by TNF-beta is responsible for its inhibitory activities on proliferation. At concentrations of 1-2 fg/cell TGF-beta is a growth inhibitor for smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and chondrocytes while higher concentrations promote proliferation. This bimodal activity is mediated by PDGF-AA the synthesis and secretion of which is stimulated by low concentrations of TGF-beta while higher concentrations of TGF-beta downregulate the expression of the PDGF receptor and hence the biological activities of PDGF. </p>
<p>PDGF-AA, in contrast to PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB, is a poor mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. However, together with bFGF, which upregulates PDGF-alpha receptors, it acts synergistically on DNA synthesis of these cells. PDGF does not act on epithelial cells and endothelial cells because these cell types do not express PDGF receptors. It has been shown that PDGF-BB is a potent mediator of connective tissue stroma formation in xenotransplanted human melanoma cells genetically engineered to secrete PDGF-BB, thereby facilitating the formation of a functional vascular system in the tumor (see also: Angiogenesis). </p>
<p>PDGF regulates the synthesis of its own receptor and also influences the expression of membrane receptors for IL1, EGF, 5-Hydroxytryptamine, LDL, transferrin, and muscarinergic receptors (see also: Receptor transmodulation). PDGF induces the expression of many new genes in a plethora of cell types. Many of these genes also function as cytokines (see: Chemokines). </p>
<p>The functional consequences of the heterogeneity of PDGF are largely unknown. The dimeric form of PDGF is mainly mitogenic for cells of mesenchymal origin while monomeric forms of PDGF are mainly chemotactic (see also: Chemotaxis). Depending upon the cell type, the various isoforms of PDGF may stimulate or inhibit chemotactic responses. </p>
<p>PDGF supports the proliferation and mobility of oligodendrocytes/type 1 astrocytes and inhibits the premature differentiation of their progenitor cells. The neurotrophic and neuroregulatory activities (see also: Neurotrophins) of PDGF are demonstrated also by the fact that PDGF is involved in the development of the nervous system since PDGF-B receptors are expressed in almost all areas of the central nervous system. </p>
<p>At low concentrations PDGF is a chemoattractant for fibroblasts (see also: Chemotaxis). PDGF is also chemotactic and activating for monocytes and neutrophils. (see also: cell activation) and activates the arachidonic acid cascade in these cells. PDGF is also a potent modulator of T-cell functions. PDGF is also a potent chemoattractant for several hematopoietic cell types (see also: hematopoiesis) and cells of mesenchymal origin. PDGF is a potent vasoconstrictor. </p>
<p>PDGF-A and the alpha receptor are expressed selectively and transiently in early embryonic development of vertebrates and also in embryonic carcinoma cells. The analysis of the murine dominant Patch (Ph) mutation has revealed that deletions of the alpha receptor causes severe anatomical alterations. These mutations are lethal. It can therefore be assumed that the function of PDGF during embryonic development is different from those in adult organisms. </p>
<p>The mitogenic activities of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB are modulated by binding of PAP [PDGF-associated protein]. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>A transgenic model in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was placed under transcriptional control of the PDGF B-chain promoter demonstrates that the transgene is expressed preferentially within neural cell bodies in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. PDGF may act as a neuronal regulatory agent with neuronal release of PDGF contributing to nerve regeneration and to glial proliferation that leads to gliosis and scarring. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>PDGF can be assayed by means of a competitive enzymoimmunoassay or a radioreceptor assay or in assays using 3T3 fibroblasts. Fredriksson et al (2002) have described a technique in which the simultaneous binding of two DNA aptamer probes directed against PDGF allows detection of zeptomole (40 x 10**-21 mol) amounts of PDGF without washes or separations. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>Some initial studies suggest that PDGF (alone and in combination) may be useful in promoting bone formation and in soft tissue repair. Local application of recombinant PDGF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) to bed ulcers has been shown to shorten the time required for healing. </p>
<p>PDGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibroproliferative disorders and is closely associated with the presence of established disease. Markedly elevated levels of PDGF have been observed in obliterative bronchiolitis, a frequently fatal fibroproliferative disorder leading to the occlusion of small airways and affecting up to 30 % of lung transplant recipients. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that autocrine loops established by co-expression of PDGF and its receptor may contribute to the growth of malignant astrocytomas in humans. </p>
