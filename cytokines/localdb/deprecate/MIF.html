<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-4-) migration inhibition factor, migration inhibitory factor, macrophage inhibition factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MMIF) </p>
<p>An operational definition for factors that inhibit in vitro the migration of macrophages out of capillary tubes or small pieces of tissue (see also: Motogenic cytokines). Many proteins have been described to possess MIF activity, including TNF, IFN-gamma, IL1, IL2, GM-CSF (see also: LIF (leukocyte migration inhibitory factor). The proteins known as MRP-8 and MRP-14 (MIF-related protein) are MIF-related proteins that are recognized by some monoclonal antibodies directed against MIF activities. They are related to Calgranulins. </p>
<p>Another protein, called MIF-1, with MIF activity is secreted by a T-cell hybridoma. Another biochemically uncharacterized migration inhibitory factor is F5MIF-2. Another factor influencing the chemotactic behavior of neutrophilic macrophages (see also: Chemotaxis) is HDLF (Hodgkin-derived leukocyte factor). In addition there are many other biochemically uncharacterized factors with MIF activity that cannot be blocked by antibodies against known cytokines and that are therefore probably distinct factors. </p>
<p>MMIF has been cloned and has been shown to be a major secreted protein released by anterior pituitary cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. It is identical with Sarcolectin binding protein. Pituitary-derived MIF contributes to circulating MIF present in the post-acute phase of endotoxinemia (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome). Recombinant murine MIF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) greatly enhances lethality when co-injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharides and anti-MIF antibodies confer protection against lethal endotoxinemia. One particular factor with MIF activity is found also in chicken murine and human embryonic eye lenses (see: 10K protein). The human gene for this factor has been mapped by Budarf et al (1997) to chromosome 22q11.2. </p>
<p>A 12 kDa factor of 115 amino acids that also inhibits the migration of macrophages is produced by antigen-stimulated T-cells. These proteins show extensive sequence homology with each other and with a rat liver protein, designated TRANSMIF, a murine protein designated GIF (glycosylation inhibiting factor), and a mouse delayed-early response gene, designated DER6 [delayed early response gene 6]. These highly homologous proteins, sharing sequence homologies of up to 98 %, are structurally related to the theta-class of Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), a subclass of GSTs thought to be the most ancient evolutionary GST class. All proteins have retained a glutathione binding domain and demonstrate transferase activity. GSTs protect against xenobiotic chemicals by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione, which renders them non-toxic. Mouse, human and chicken macrophage migration inhibitory factor has been found to be highly homologous to rat liver 13k protein. </p>
<p> The receptor for MIF has been shown to be CD74 (Leng et al, 2003). The receptor complex uses CD44 as a signaling coreceptor (Shi et al, 2006). </p>
<p> MIF is known as a mediator of cellular immunity with specific effects on the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. The expression of MIF activity correlates well with delayed hypersensitivity and cellular immunity in humans and MIF is now recognized as a principal cytokine modulating T-cell / macrophage interactions in the expression of delayed hypersensitivity and acquired cellular immunity. Recombinant human MIF is responsible for the specific activation of macrophages to kill intracellular parasites such as Mycobacterium avium and Leishmania donovani. </p>
<p>Recombinant human MIF has been shown to activate macrophage expression of NO, a potent antimicrobial agent that is produced by the NO synthase mediated oxidation of terminal L-arginine guanidine nitrogen atoms. </p>
<p>Recombinant human MIF upregulates expression of genes encoding HLA-DR and IL1-beta (see: IL1) and elaboration of IL1-beta by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human recombinant MIF can also activate cultured human peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to become cytotoxic for tumor cells in vitro. MIF also induces macrophages to produce TNF-alpha and IL1-beta (see: IL1). MIF also stimulates nitric oxide production by macrophages primed with IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Administration of soluble bovine serum albumin or human immunodeficiency virus 120 kDa glycoprotein to mice in the presence of recombinant MIF together with incomplete Freund's adjuvant induces a strong T-cell proliferative response comparable to that of complete Freund's adjuvant. Recombinant MIF also increases antibody production, especially of IgG1 and IgM, in mice. MIF may be useful, therefore, as an adjuvant in the development of vaccines. </p>
<p>MIF activity can be detected in the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The expression of MIF at sites of inflammation also suggests a role for the mediator in regulating the function of macrophages in host defense. </p>
<p>For a homolog of MIF encoded by a parasite see also: Bm-MIF. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Takahashi et al (1998) have investigated the expression of MIF in a colon cancer cell line (colon 26 cells) and its correlation with cell proliferation. Sublines from tumors obtained by serial transplantation in mice showed a significantly higher in vitro cell proliferation rate than the parent cell line and also showed higher levels of expression of MIF protein and mRNA. Transfection of antisense RNA against MIF into the parent cell line suppressed cell growth significantly. The authors point out that MIF may work as a growth factor for tumor cell growth and may be involved in the mechanism of metastasis. </p>
