<h1>CXCL10</h1>

    <h2>CXCL10</h2>
    
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL10 has been identified independently as IP-10 [Interferon-inducible protein-10], known also as INP-10. The factor is identical with CRG-2, C7, Ifi10, mob-1. An older designation is SCYB10 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 10]. </p>
<p> Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL10 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. Cole et al (2001) have reported that CXCL10 possesses antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Proost et al (2003) have shown that CXCL10 produced by connective tissue fibroblasts attracts activated Th1 cells and natural killer cells expressing the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 to sites of infection, can also antagonize the CCR3 dependent attraction of Th2 lymphocytes, and exerts CXCR3-independent, defensin-like antibacterial activity. </p>
<p>Hensbergen et al (2004) have reported that native chemokine CXCL10 is processed in primary keratinocytes by furin to a shorter form that lacks four amino acids at the C-terminus. The truncated CXCL10 variant is a potent ligand for CXCR3 and retains its direct antibacterial activity. </p>
<p>Egesten et al (2007) have reported that CXCL10 possesses antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, a common agent causing streptococcal pharyngitis. This activity is neutralized by a bacterial virulence factor, SIC </p>
<p>Loos et al (2008) have shown that protein citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase of CXCL10 is a naturally occurring posttranslational modification. Citrullination reduces the chemoattracting and signaling capacity of CXCL10 for CXC-Chemokine receptor CXCR3 but does not affect receptor binding. The citrullinated chemokine remains active on T-cells but is weaker than authentic CXCL10. Deimination decreases heparin binding properties of CXCL10. </p>

    <h2>IP-10</h2>
    
<p>[Interferon-inducible protein-10; IFN-inducible protein 10; immune protein-10; inflammatory protein 10; 10 kDa interferon-inducible protein] also: gamma-IP-10 or INP-10. IP-10 is called also C7. The rat homolog of this protein is called mob-1. According to a new systematic nomenclature the name CXCL10 has been proposed for this factor. The gene symbol is SCYB10. Based on the presence of a conserved three-dimensional motif and direct microbicidal activity, IP-10 has been classified as a kinocidin (microbicidal chemokine). </p>
<p>The protein has a length of 98 amino acids. It shows homology to PF4 (platelet factor-4) and belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines. IP-10 is also related to a gene called CRG-2 (see: CRG, cytokine responsive genes). Murine CRG-2 and human IP-10 are considered homologous </p>
<p>The human IP-10 genes contains four exons and maps to chromosome 4q12-21 in the vicinity of other genes encoding chemokines. </p>
<p>The receptor for IP-10 is CXCR3. IP-10 has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p>The expression of IP-10 from a variety of cells, including monocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, is induced by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Human neutrophils produce IP-10 in response to IFN-gamma in combination with either TNF-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharides and this response is blocked by IL10 and IL4. IFN-gamma, alone or in association with agonists such as fMLP, IL8, G-CSF and GM-CSF have no effect. IFN-alpha, in combination with TNF-alpha, LPS, or IL1-beta, result in a considerable induction of IP-10 release by neutrophils (Gasperini et al, 1999). Sauty et al (1999) have shown that IFN-gamma strongly induces expression of IP-10, and the two chemokines mig and I-TAC in activated bronchial epithelium and thus may play a role in pulmonary diseases by recruiting activated T-cells. </p>
<p>The induction of the synthesis of IP-10 is used as an assay of IFN-gamma activities. </p>
<p>IP-10 has been detected in keratinocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and endothelial cells in immunologically mediated processes, such as positive tuberculin skin tests, and in growth-activated keratinocytes, such as in psoriasis. Keratinocytes in normal epidermis do not produce gamma-IP-10. In vivo murine IP-10 is synthesized predominantly in the liver and the kidney after intravenous injection of inflammatory agents, and in particular after injection of IFN-gamma, and may play an important role in the response of liver and kidney to systemic inflammation. IP-10 mRNA expression is more sensitive to suppression by IL4 when stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides than by IFN-gamma/IL2. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that IP-10 may play an important role in hypersensitivity reactions of the delayed type. Increased levels of IP-10 are found in psoriatic plaques characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils. IP-10, however, does not activate neutrophils. </p>
<p>IP-10 probably also plays a role in regulation of the growth of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis). It has been shown to suppress in vitro colony formation of highly enriched cells expressing the cell surface marker CD34 in the presence of SCF, GM-CSF, or SCF + Epo, but not in their absence with the exception of SCF. </p>
<p>Tumor cells genetically engineered to express high levels of murine IP-10 have been shown to elicit a powerful host mediated antitumor effect in vivo which appears to be mediated by the recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. IP-10 has been shown also to be a potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. </p>
<p>Marx et al (2000) have shown that treatment of endothelical cells with activators of a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), significantly inhibits induction of expression by IFN-gamma of IP-10 and the chemokines mig and I-TAC. </p>
<p>Teruya-Feldstein et al (1997) have reported higher levels of IP-10 and mig gene expression in tissues with necrosis and vascular damage from EBV positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis and nasal or nasal-type T/natural killer cell lymphomas. They also find that circulating levels of IP-10 are abnormally elevated in these patients. </p>
<p>Romagnani et al (1999) have reported that mig induces proliferation of human mesangial cells. They suggest that this chemokine may act not only as a chemoattractant for infiltrating mononuclear but also directly induce the proliferation of mesangial cells in patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis. Kanegane et al (1998) have suggested that IP-10 and also mig contribute to the antitumor effects of IL12 through their inhibitory effects on tumor vasculature. </p>
<p>This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CXCL10.
