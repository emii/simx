<p> </p>
<p>Fibroblasts are the most ubiquitous cell type within the body and have long been considered to be important structural elements of tissue integrity. It has been recognized that fibroblasts, or distinct subpopulations thereof, perform functions that go beyond that of structural elements. Tissue-specific fibroblasts play an important role as immunoregulatory cells (see also: sentinel cells) that can mount and influence immune responses by being able to secrete chemokines and cytokines, which are able to trigger immune responses by attracting inflammatory cells and immune cells (Smith et al, 1997; Buckley et al, 2001; Kaufman et al, 2001; Silzle et al, 2003, 2004) </p>
<p>Fibroblasts from different anatomical locations show an array of common phenotypic attributes and are capable of expressing multiple regulatory molecules, including cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, cell surface antigens and adhesion molecules, and low molecular weight substances. This enables them to influence their microenvironment, and also to respond to environmental cues, in a complex manner. Fibroblastic cells or fibroblastoid cells have the morphological appearance of fibroblasts. The development of such cells is observed frequently after prolonged culture of a variety of different non-fibroblast cell types. This term does not imply that these cells are fibroblasts. For a cell type showing features of fibroblasts and chondrocytes see also: fibrochondrocytes. </p>
<p>Fibroblasts may, however, show distinct phenotypes in different anatomical locations. Specialized fibroblasts that display morphologic and biochemical features similar to smooth muscle cells are called myofibroblasts. Fibroblast-like cells that are found between the cartilaginous fibers in the synovial membrane of joints are called synoviocytes. Examples of site-specific phenotypes are characteristic expression patterns of receptors (Smith et al, 1993), cell surface molecules (Smith et al, 1995; Fries et al, 1994), gangliosides (Berenson and Smith, 1995; Smith et al, 1997), glycosaminoglycan components of the extracellular matrix (Smith et al, 1997, 1982, 1991, 1995; Smith, 1984, 1987), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (Cao et al, 1995; Hogg et al, 1995; Smith et al, 1992; Smith and Higgins, 1993), and PG endoperoxide H synthase-2 (Wang et al, 1996). Fibroblasts of tumors are known to exhibit distinct expression profiles and also possess different angiogenic and tumorigenic properties (see: Cancer-associated fibroblasts). </p>
<p>The following lists mediators known to be expressed by fibroblasts from various anatomical locations. These factors may have autocrine, paracrine or endocrine functions, affecting many other cell types. Expression of most of these mediators is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and other influences and may differ in fetal, adult, and activated fibroblasts or cells derived from different anatomical locations or different disease conditions. Differences in gene expression patterns most likely reflect intrinsic functional differences such as tissue-specific activities of fibroblast populations. </p>
<p> Fibroblasts have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
