<h1>neutrophils</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>These cells are known also as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (abbr. PMN) (which also contains minor populations of other cell types) or neutrophilic granulocytes or neutrophilic leukocytes. The avian counterparts are being referred to as heterophils. </p>
<p>Neutrophils develop in a complex series of developmental stages (granulopoiesis) from precursor cells (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, Band cells). The precursor cells themselves develop from progenitor cells (CFU-GM, CFU-G), and these are derived from myeloid stem cells. Segmented neutrophils (neutrophilic segmented granulocytes or simply segmented cells, segmented granulocytes) are identified by a nucleus that is divided into definite lobes joined by filaments. These cells are the morphologically most mature cell of the myelocytic series. They are mature and fully functional neutrophils, capable of active motility, able to respond to chemotaxis, and capable of performing phagocytosis. Band cells (neutrophilic stab granulocytes, band neutrophils, band forms, stab cells) represent neutrophils that have just been released from the bone marrow. The name derives from a band-shaped or horseshoe-shaped nucleus frequently observed in these cells. Band cells are almost mature neutrophils and possesses full motility, active adhesion properties and some phagocytic abilities. </p>
<p>For subpopulations anti-tumorigenic and pro-tumorigenic neutrophils see also: tumor-associated neutrophils.  </p>
<p>Neutrophils are the most numerous leukocytes in the peripheral blood (60-70 % of leukocyte counts). They possess a multilobed nucleus and a salmon pink cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic granules are near the limit of resolution of the light microscope. Neutrophils are a critical component of human innate host defense. Leukocytosis, the increased release of these cells from the bone marrow, is a reliable diagnostic marker for infection and other inflammatory processes occurring in the absence of an infection. </p>
<p>Neutrophils are actively engaged in phagocytosis. Neutrophils rapidly accumulate at a site of infection and are instrumental in providing a host defense against most invading micro-organisms. Cells that have ingested micro-organisms are thought to be removed by programmed cell death (apoptosis), which most likely also prevents damage to healthy tissues and may be critical for the resolution of inflammation caused by cell activation of neutrophils (Savill, 1997; Savill et al, 1989; Kobayashi et al, 2002, 2003). </p>
<p>Mature circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils have a relatively short life-span of 8-12 hours. The pool of circulating cells is constantly renewed from the bone marrow. The life-span of these cells can be prolonged in response to various cytokines and they may persist in infected tissues or under conditions of inflammation and acquire additional functions, e. g., of dendritic-like cells. Thus, polymorphonuclear neutrophils are not truly terminally differentiated cells (Galligan and Yoshimura, 2003). </p>
<p>The cytoplasm of neutrophils contains two major types of granules (Borregaard and Cowland, 1997). The most numerous type are specific granules (secondary granules) which, among other things, contain collagenase, lactoferrin, bacteriocidal phagocytins, and lysozyme. Azurophilic granules (primary granules), so named because they stain with methylene azure, are less numerous and larger. They are most commonly found in granulocyte precursors (promyelocytes) and are not specific for neutrophils. These granules represent primary lysosomes, which contain myeloperoxidase, acid hydrolases characteristic of lysosomes, and also granulocyte elastase and unglycosylated forms of defensins. Granule contents are released in a controlled manner as a consequence of cell activation in a process called degranulation (Galligan and Yoshimura, 2003; Theilgaard-Mnch et al, 2005). </p>
<p>Neutrophils have the capacity to express (for reviews of granule contents and global expression profiles under various circumstances see also: Borregaard and Cowland, 1997; Faurschou and Borregaard, 2003; Subrahmanyam et al, 2001; Fessler et al, 2002; Malcolm et al, 2003; Kobayashi et al, 2002; Theilgaard-Mnch et al, 2004; Borregaard and Cowland, 1997; O'Neill et al, 2004; Kobayashi et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2004; Tsukahara et al, 2003; Bussiere et al, 2002). </p>
<p> Neutrophils have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
