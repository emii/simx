<h1>IL9</h1>

    <h2>IL9</h2>
    
<p>Interleukin-9. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>MCGF (mast cell growth factor); MEA (mast cell growth enhancing activity); Megakaryoblast growth factor; P40; TCGF-3 (T-cell growth factor-3). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL9 can be isolated from culture conditioned medium of mitogen- or antigen-stimulated T-helper cells. In cultures of primary lymphocytes it is produced predominantly by cells expressiong CD4. The synthesis of IL9 can be induced by Phorbol esters and Calcium ionophore. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL9 is a protein of 14 kDa. The cDNA encodes a protein of 144 amino acids with a secretory signal sequence of 18 amino acids. IL9 is glycosylated extensively, has an isoelectric point of pI = 10 and contains ten cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonding. Human and murine IL9 show 69 % sequence homology at the nucleotide level and 55 % homology at the protein level. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human and murine IL9 genes have a length of approximately 4 kb and contain five exons. The murine and the human IL9 genes share approximately 69 % Homology. The human gene maps to chromosome 5q31-32 which is a chromosomal region sometimes deleted in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (see also: 5q minus syndrome). The murine IL9 gene maps to chromosome 13 distal to Tcrg and proximal to Dhfr. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The approved gene symbol for this receptor is IL9R. </p>
<p>The murine receptor is a glycoprotein of 64 kDa (54 kDa unglycosylated; 468 amino acids) that binds IL9 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM. The human receptor gene encodes a protein of 522 amino acids with 53 % homology to the mouse IL9 receptor. Homologies are particularly pronounced in the extracellular regions (67 %). Variants of the receptor arising by alternative splicing and lacking the sequences encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains have been described also. The human IL9 receptor gene consists of 10 exons spread over approximately 13.7 kb of DNA. </p>
<p>The receptor is expressed in IL9 responsive cells at a density of approximately 3000/cell. Like many other cytokines binding of IL9 to its receptor leads to the formation of complexes that are rapidly internalized and degraded by the cells. The receptor is expressed in membrane-bound and soluble forms. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Murine IL9 stimulates human cells but human IL9 is inactive on murine cells. IL9 stimulates the proliferation of a number of T-helper cell clones in the absence of antigens or antigen-presenting cells. It does not promote the proliferation of freshly isolated T-cells or cytolytic T-cells. The activity as a growth factor therefore appears to be restricted to a distinct subpopulation of cells or may be discernible only in cells of a particular activation state (see also: cell activation). </p>
<p>After activation of the T-cell receptor IL1 is a very potent costimulator for the synthesis of IL9. Antibodies directed against IL2 block the synthesis of IL9 in human T-lymphocytes. IL9 potentiates the production of IgG, IgM, and IgE by normal human B-lymphocytes induced by IL4. IL9 also induces functional changes such as secretion of IL6 by cell lines derived from mast cells. IL9 is also a potent regulator of the expression of protease genes like those belonging to the granzyme family. </p>
<p>In the presence of IL3 IL9 enhances the proliferation of bone marrow mast cells. IL9 synergises with Epo and selectively supports a subpopulation of an early class of BFU-E that respond to IL3 (see also: FDCPmix). IL9 also stimulations erythroid progenitors in normal human bone marrow in the absence of serum. IL9 also stimulates colony formation of CFU-E. IL9 induces the production of IL6 by mast cells and some other cell types. This effect is synergised by IL4. </p>
<p>IL9 also stimulates the proliferation of fetal thymocytes and murine thymic lymphomas in response to IL2. IL9 also promotes the proliferation of some leukemia cell lines. </p>
<p>The introduction of an expressed IL9 gene in factor-dependent cell lines abolishes the growth factor requirement. If these cells are injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into syngeneic animals they develop T-cell tumors. It can therefore be assumed that the uncontrolled expression of IL9 is involved in the development of certain types of T-cell tumors. </p>
<p>Mice overexpressing IL9 show increased mast cell numbers in the intestinal mucosa, suggesting that this cytokine may play a role also in intestinal inflammation. The analysis of colons from IL9 transgenic mice shows that IL9 induces Paneth cell hyperplasia in LieberkÂŸhn glands of the small intestine, and in the colonic mucosa, where this cell type is normally absent. Expression of Paneth cell markers such as angiogenin-4, PLA2g2a, and cryptdins, is induced in the colon of wild-type mice after two to four daily administrations of IL9. IL13 is required for the up-regulation of these Paneth cell-specific genes by IL9 (Steenwinckel et al, 2009).  </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL9 can be detected in bioassays employing cells that respond to the factor (see: L138.8A; TS1). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL9 is expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells and Hodgkin lymphoma cells and some large aplastic lymphoma cells, while non-Hodgkin lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas do not express it. IL9 may play a role, therefore, in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease and large cell anaplastic lymphoma and has been shown to function as an autocrine growth modulator for Hodgkin's cell lines. Constitutive expression of IL9 has been demonstrated also in HTLV-I-transformed T-cells. </p>
