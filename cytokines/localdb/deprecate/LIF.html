<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>This factor is produced by various cell lines established from fibroblasts, antigen-stimulated alloreactive T-lymphocytes, mitogen-activated spleen cells, and Krebs and Ehrlich ascites cells. The factor is produced also by monocytes after cell activation. Human lung fibroblasts and umbilical chord endothelial cells produce LIF constitutively. The synthesis in mesenchymal cells of LIF can be induced by IL1-alpha (see: IL1), TGF-beta, EGF, and bFGF. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>LIF is a heavily and variably glycosylated 58 kDa protein. with a length of 179 amino acids. Glycosylation does not appear to be essential for bioactivity. Two different glycosylation variants have been designated as LIF-A and LIF-B. </p>
<p>The murine and human factors show a homology of 79 % at the amino acid level. Both factors show a high degree of conservative amino acid exchanges. The factor is produced as a soluble protein and also as a variant bound to the extracellular matrix. Both variants arise from alternatively spliced transcripts. </p>
<p>Several alternatively spliced isoforms of LIF have been described (LIF-D, LIF-M, LIF-T). All isoforms contain common second and third exons and differ in 3 alternate first exons (D, M, T). Human LIF-D is a biologically active secreted protein that can signal via the LIF receptor. Human LIF-M is secreted and also exists as an intracellular protein. Secreted LIF-M can be active in the extracellular matrix. LIF-T exists as an intracellular protein with a leucine zipper motif and may function as a transcription factor LIF-T is a truncated protein localized within the cell and can act as a LIF receptor agonist. These transcripts are expressed in a variety of different cell types, are regulated independently, and may have distinct biological functions (Voyle et al, 1999; Rathjen et al, 1990; Haines et al, 2000; Robertson et al, 1993). Overexpression of the LIF-M, but not of LIF-D, during early mouse embryogenesis results in gastrulation defects (Conquet et al, 1992). </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human gene has a length of 6.2 kb. It contains three exons and an unusually long 3' untranslated region of approximately 3.2 kb. The transcript has a length of 4.1 kb. </p>
<p>The human gene maps to chromosome 22q12-q12.2 approximately 15 kb away from a chromosomal breakpoint for a translocation (t(11;22) (q24;q12). This translocation is found in practically all Ewing sarcomas and peripheral neuroepitheliomas and serves as a cytogenetic marker for these two tumor types. The human gene encoding Oncostatin M lies at a distance of approximately 16 kb. </p>
<p>The murine LIF gene maps to chromosome 11 (subbands A1-A2) which is more or less syntenic with human chromosome 22q. The murine gene maps to a chromosomal region with a high incidence of chromosomal alterations in embryonic carcinoma cells. </p>
<p>The murine and human LIF genes show a homology of approximately 75 % mainly restricted to the coding sequences but also including some parts of the 5' and 3' ends of the transcription unit. An exon corresponding to the 5' end of a variant LIF transcript in the mouse that encodes a potentially matrix-associated form of LIF is not conserved in the human, ovine and porcine genes. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>Macrophages, monocytes, and their precursors express approximately 300-500 high-affinity receptors (Kdis = 10-200 picoM) per cell. </p>
<p>Another receptor expressed with a density of 2000-6000 copies per cell (Kdis = 1-3 nM) has been described also. </p>
<p>One component of the LIF receptor is a 130 kDa glycoprotein, gp130. gp130 is also a component of the receptor for IL6, IL11, CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor), and Oncostatin M, and CT-1. CT-1 also binds directly to a purified soluble form of the LIF receptor. gp130 functions as the signal transducer subunit for the receptor. This finding also explains that these factors share several common biological activities although the factors themselves are not related to each other. </p>
<p>A glycoprotein of approximately 90 kDa, designated LBP (LIF binding protein, LIFR-beta) that specifically binds LIF has been isolated from normal mouse serum. It is a soluble truncated form of the alpha chain of the cellular receptor (see: LIFR) and probably serves as an inhibitor of the systemic effects of locally produced LIF because it acts as a competitive inhibitor of LIF binding to its cellular receptor. This protein has been found also to be involved in the formation of functional receptors for CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) and Oncostatin M and heterodimerises with gp130. In addition, soluble and membrane-bound forms of MPR300 (CIM6PR) have been found to bind LIF. </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of human LIF are not species-specific; human LIF is fully active in murine cells and even binds with higher affinity to the murine LIF receptor. Murine LIF, however, binds only to the mouse receptor. </p>
<p>Some of the bioactivities of LIF can be mediated by the factor bound to the extracellular matrix acting on nearby cells (see also: juxtacrine). Some observations point to the fact that the diffusible form of LIF and the membrane-bound form differ in their biological activities. </p>
<p>LIF was isolated initially as a factor that inhibits many, but not all, myeloid leukemia cells and induces their differentiation into macrophages. For some myeloid leukemia cell lines such as M1 a short pulse of LIF is sufficient to initiate irreversible differentiation. LIF also prolongs the Cell cycle of stem cells in some AML cell lines probably by increasing the time spent in the G2-M-G1 phase of the cell cycle. </p>
<p>LIF by itself does not possess colony stimulating activity (see also: CSF) for early human bone marrow cells expressing the cell surface marker CD34. It also does not influence the number, size, and differentiation of normal colonies induced by GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF and IL3 in a colony formation assay. The colony formation of IL3 dependent primitive blast cells (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines), however, is promoted by LIF almost as well as by G-CSF or IL6. This suggests that LIF plays a role in the regulation of very immature hematopoietic cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Cultured normal human bone marrow stromal cells (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture) constitutively express LIF message. Exposure of these cells to IL1, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha (but not IFN-alpha) increases the level of LIF mRNA. Cultured stromal cells derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia show enhanced LIF expression. LIF may participate, either alone or through interaction with other cytokines, in the bone marrow microenvironment mediated influence on both normal and malignant hematopoietic processes. </p>
<p>LIF has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of endothelial cells. LIF is a factor that inhibits adipogenesis by inhibiting the lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes. The inhibition of this enzyme probably reduces uptake of fatty acids by adipocytes and leads to catabolism of lipids in fat tissue. Mice with a high blood level of LIF suffer from weight loss and are also cachectic. In addition one also observes an accumulation of osteoblasts in the bone marrow and formation of new bone tissues and calcifications in the heart and skeletal muscles. A marked increase in the number of hematopoietic cells is found in spleen and liver. In mice injected with LIF, counts of megakaryocytes and platelets rise. </p>
<p>In cultured neuronal cells LIF influences the type of neurotransmitter expressed and induces differentiation into cell types expressing cholinergic transmitter. LIF induces the expression of choline acetyltransferase and represses, among other things, the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. LIF also influences the development of sensory neurons. LIF is involved probably in the regulation of growth and development of the nervous system. In vitro it stimulates the differentiation of embryonic neural crest cells into cell types resembling sensory neurons. It also supports the development and maintenance of such cells. LIF has been shown by RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines to induce synthesis of mRNAs for choline acetyltransferase, Somatostatin, SP (substance P), VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide), cholecystokinin, and enkephalin in cultured sympathetic neurons. </p>
<p>The expression of LIF in murine blastocysts before onset of hematopoietic differentiation suggests that LIF regulates the growth and development of trophoblasts and/or embryonic stem cells. LIF is expressed very early during the differentiation of ES cells (embryonic stem cells) and inhibits their differentiation as long as it is present. This factor is therefore important for culturing these cells and for generating transgenic animals. </p>
<p>By a mechanism requiring the synthesis of prostaglandins LIF also stimulates bone resorption and bone formation and may be involved, therefore, in regulating osteoblast and osteoclast functions. </p>
<p>LIF induces the synthesis of acute phase proteins in hepatocytes (see also: acute phase reaction). </p>
<p>The expression of LIF in uterine tissues is initiated at a time corresponding to the nidation of the blastocyst. It may be involved, therefore, also in the growth regulation of the blastocyst and the implantation of the embryo. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The overexpression of LIF in transgenic mice has been shown to be lethal, leading to the absence of mesodermal cells and the inhibition of gastrulation in the embryos. Chimaeric mouse embryos overexpressing the diffusible form of LIF cDNA look essentially normal. Chimerae expressing LIF associated with the extracellular matrix show an abnormal proliferation of tissues and the absence of differentiated mesoderm. They have not undertaken the normal pathway of gastrulation. </p>
<p>The study of transgenic mice specifically overexpressing LIF in T-cells show that LIF plays an important role in maintaining a functional thymic epithelium that will support proper T-cell maturation. These animals display B-cell hyperplasia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. These animals also show thymic and lymph node abnormalities. Cortical CD4(+) CD8(+) lymphocytes are lost in the thymus while numerous B-cell follicles develop. Peripheral lymph nodes contain a vastly expanded the population of CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive lymphocytes. The thymic epithelium is profoundly disorganized. Transplantation studies indicate that lymph node abnormalities can be rescued by wild type bone marrow but that the thymic defect cannot be rescued. This indicates that the thymic epithelium is irreversibly altered. </p>
<p>LIF deficient knock-out mice have been generated by targeted disruption of the gene in ES cells and subsequent generation of transgenic animals. In spite of its important functions in vitro for the development of ES cells LIF does not appear to be important for the development of viable adults. Embryos of homozygous LIF deficient mice fail to implant in the uterus but can be rescued by transfer to the uterus of normal LIF mice or heterozygous mice. </p>
<p>The analysis of these animals shows that LIF appears to be required for the survival of the normal pool of stem cells, but not for their terminal differentiation. Animals without LIF have dramatically decreased numbers of stem cells in spleen and bone marrow (see also: hematopoiesis). The remaining LIF negative stem cells are pluripotent as shown by their ability to promote long-term survival of lethally irradiated wild-type animals. LIF negative stem cells appear to interact differently with the splenic and medullary microenvironment since the numbers of committed progenitors are reduced in the spleen but not the bone marrow. Heterozygous LIF negative animals have an intermediate phenotype, implying that LIF has a dosage effect. The defects in stem cell number can be compensated by administration of exogenous LIF. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of a low affinity LIF receptor gene disruption have been studied in knock-out mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Transgenic mutant mice develop to term but do not survive beyond the day of birth. The animals show severe osteopenia of perinatal bone. Numbers of astrocytes are reduced in the spinal cord and brain stem. A metabolic disorder is indicated by the state of late gestation fetal livers, which contain relatively high stores of glycogen. Hematologic and primordial germ cell compartments appear normal (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>LIF can be assayed in bioassays employing cell lines that depend on, or respond to, the factor (see: Da; M1; NBFL). A colorimetric assay and an ELISA assay are also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The enhancement of platelet counts observed in experimental animals suggest that LIF, either alone or in combination with other factors, may be valuable in the treatment of thrombocytopenias. It may be possible also to use this factor in combination with colony stimulating factors G-CSF and GM-CSF to induce differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. </p>
<p>LIF has been found in the urine, but not in the serum, of patients showing an acute graft-versus-host reaction following kidney transplantation. Therefore, the detection of LIF may be of diagnostic value. </p>
