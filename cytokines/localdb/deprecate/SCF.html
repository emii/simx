<p>abbr. usually SCF. </p>
<p>Note: the abbreviation SCF has been used also for Sertoli cell factor. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>HLGF-1 (hemolymphopoietic growth factor-1); KL (kit ligand); MC/9 cell growth-promoting factor (MC/9-GF), see: MC/9; Mast/stem cell growth factor MGF (multipotent growth factor); MGF (mast cell growth factor); SCGF (stem cell growth factor); SLF (steel factor).

<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>SCF is a stromal cell-derived cytokine synthesized by fibroblasts and other cell types (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture); Stromal cell line, Hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>SCF is a protein of 164 amino acids (BRL cells, rat) or 248 amino acids (human). The protein is extensively N- and O-glycosylated. Glycosylation is not required for biological activity since the non-glycosylated recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli is biologically fully active (see also: Recombinant cytokines). The domain structure and some of the biochemical properties of SCF resemble those of M-CSF. </p>
<p>The murine protein forms dimers. It displays approximately 80 % sequence homology with the human factor. Proteolytic cleavage of a longer membrane-bound precursor protein of 220 and 248 amino acids, respectively, yields the active murine and human factor. The precursor also possesses biological activity. Differential expression of soluble (designated also or SCF-1) and membrane-bound forms of the factor (designated KL-1, KL-2, or SCF-2) is achieved by alternative splicing of the corresponding mRNAs. The membrane-bound form of SCF can mediate specific cell-to-cell contacts by interaction with receptors on near-by cells (see: juxtacrine). </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding SCF maps to human chromosome 12q22-q24. It has a length of approximately 70 kb and contains 21 exons. </p>
<p>The murine KL gene is identical with the SL (Steel) locus identified by many lethal mutations. It maps to murine chromosome 10. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The receptor for SCF, designated SCFR, is the oncogene designated kit. In the nomenclature of CD antigens it has been given the designation CD117. </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Rat SCF is as active as human SCF with respect to the induction of proliferation of bone marrow stem cells. Human SCF is approximately 800-fold less active on murine cells than rat SCF. Murine SCF is active on human cells and can be employed in long-term BMC (bone marrow culture). </p>
<p>Mutated alleles of SCF with deletions in the coding region and also mutations in the receptor gene (see: kit) are lethal and cause the early death of homozygous embryos in mice. These animals display a pronounced anemia and severe impairment of development of the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis) characterized by a very pronounced deficiency of mast cells. The anemia and mast cells deficiency observed in animals with mutations in the Sl gene can be abolished by administration of SCF. </p>
<p>In vitro SCF is a growth factor for primitive lymphoid and myeloid hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells expressing the early cell surface marker CD34 or murine Sca-1 (see also: hematopoiesis); see also: BFU-E (burst-forming unit erythroid). The action of SCF on mouse and human hematopoietic progenitors is inhibited by TGF-beta. </p>
<p>To date it is unclear whether SCF really is the stem cell factor because there are some indications that cells exist which are even more primitive than those responding to SCF and other factors with SCF activity have been reported (see: SCPF, stem cell proliferation factor). At least SCF appears to be one factor that is responsible for the maintenance of basal constitutive and steady-state Hematopoiesis </p>
<p>The biological activities of SCF are synergised considerably by colony stimulating factors GM-CSF and G-CSF, and also by IL7, Epo and some other growth and differentiation factors. </p>
<p>In combination with IL7 SCF stimulates the proliferation of pre-B-cells. The combination of SCF and IL7 does not stimulate the expansion or differentiation of B220(-) (= CD45(-)) lymphoid precursors but can act synergistically in the clonal proliferation of B220(+) cells. In combination with Epo SCF stimulates the proliferation of early erythroid cells (see: BFU-E), and in combination with G-CSF SCF stimulates the proliferation of granulocytes. </p>
<p>In vivo administration of SCF significantly raises the numbers of megakaryocytes and circulating platelet counts. SCF may be an important regulator of platelet production under both normal and physiologically disturbed situations. </p>
<p>The subcutaneous administration of recombinant human SCF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) to baboons (Papio cynocephalus) or cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) leads to a pronounced expansion of populations of mast cells in many anatomical sites, with numbers of mast cells in some organs by more than 100-fold. There is no clinical evidence of cell activation of mast cells, and discontinuation of treatment with SCF results in a rapid decline of numbers of mast cells nearly to baseline levels. </p>
<p>SCF is also a potent chemoattractant for cells (see also: Chemotaxis), for example, mast cells, expressing the kit receptor. One response to SCF in these cells is a characteristic rearrangement of the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. At concentrations approximately 10-100 fold lower than those eliciting cell proliferation SCF induces the synthesis of histamines and leukotriene C4 in mast cells. It has been shown that IL3 dependent mast cells (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) undergo apoptosis on removal of IL3 and that this can be prevented by the addition of SCF, thus demonstrating how these principle mast cell growth factors may act in concert to regulate numbers of mast cells under physiologic conditions. </p>
<p>Some human solid tumor cell lines display high-affinity c-kit receptors and produce SCF, suggesting the possibility that autocrine production of SCF by c-kit receptor-bearing tumor cells may enhance cell growth in tumor cell lines. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>A transgene encoding the SV40 large T antigen that is expressed specifically in a subset of thymic epithelial cells around birth causes an increase in the number of immortal thymic epithelial cells, increases thymic mass, and expands thymopoiesis. One of the immortalized cell lines derived from thymic epithelium expresses, among other things, SCF, the genes for major histocompatibility complex class 1 and class 2, Thy1, IL6, IL7, M-CSF, IL4 receptors, and TGF-beta. The expression of SCF is independent of IL4 and is enhanced dramatically in response to IL4. Since SCF, in concert with commitment factors, channels progenitors into hemopoietic lineages (see also: hematopoiesis), these experiments reveal a specific interaction between thymocytes and a specialized subset of thymic epithelial cells. </p>
<p>Transgenic mouse lines carrying the mouse metallothionein/ret fusion gene develop severe melanosis and melanocytic tumors. Crosses of these mice with mice carrying mutants in the SCF receptor demonstrate that the introduction of a functional ret oncogene can compensate for the defect of c-kit during both embryogenesis and postnatal life. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>SCF can be assayed by its growth-promoting activity on pre-B-cells in Whitlock-Witte long-term bone marrow cultures. It can be assayed also in bioassays employing cell lines that respond to the factor (see: MH11; MO7E). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>SCF is of clinical significance because of its ability to induce differentiation in lymphoid and erythroid progenitor cells and mast cells. Since this factor acts on very immature hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis) its use in combination with other cytokines might be of considerable interest in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and after bone marrow transplantation. Improved in vitro erythropoiesis with SCF has been demonstrated to occur in several types of inherited marrow failure syndromes, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Fanconi's anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood. </p>
<p>In vivo administration of recombinant SCF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) has been shown to lead to an expansion of human marrow hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. Some data suggest that the combination of SCF and IL11 may be useful in humans undergoing myeloablative therapies. Treatment with SCF stimulates the circulation of cells that engraft and rescue lethally irradiated baboons. </p>
