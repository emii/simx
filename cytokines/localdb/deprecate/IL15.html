<h1>IL15</h1>

    <h2>IL15</h2>
    
<p>Interleukin-15. This glycoprotein factor of 14-15 kDa is found in conditioned medium of a Rhesus monkey kidney epithelial cell line, CV-1/EBNA (Grabstein et al, 1994). IL15 has been shown to be identical with a previously isolated cytokine, IL-T. </p>
<p>Human IL15 has been cloned from a human stromal cell line, IMTLH (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture). It shares 97 % amino acid homology with the simian protein. The genomic structures of human and murine IL15 IL15 genes have been determined (Anderson et al, 1995, Krause et al, 1996). The human gene maps to 4q25-35 (Krause et al, 1996; Anderson et al, 1995). </p>
<p>High levels of IL15 mRNA are found in muscle and placenta, and a kidney epithelial line. The IL15 gene is expressed also by fibroblasts and monocytes. T-cells, the major source for IL2, do not express IL15 mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis (Grabstein et al, 1993). An alternative splicing variant of IL15 has been observed in human small cell lung cancer cell lines (Meazza et al, 1996). </p>
<p>IL15 has been shown to be produced by human fetal astrocytes and microglial cells in response to IL1-beta, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha and may thus play a role in T-cell mediated immune responses in the human central nervous system (Lee et al, 1996). </p>
<p>Some of the biological activities of IL15 resemble those of IL2. IL15 and IL2 differ in their controls of expression and secretion, their range of target cells and their functional activities. IL15 stimulates proliferation of the established T-cell line CTLL-2 (Xiong et al, 2005; Dean et al, 2005). Ku et al (2000) have reported that CD8(+) memory T-cells require IL15 for proliferation. The balance between IL15 and IL12 may control their cell numbers. </p>
<p>IL15 is also able to induce generation of cytolytic cells and LAK cells activity in vitro. IL15 appears to function as a specific maturation factor for NK-cells and can mimic the bone marrow microenvironment in vitro, which is required for NK-cells to acquire lytic functions. (see also: hematopoiesis). It also seems to function as an NK-cell survival factor in vivo (Carson et al, 1997; Puzanov et al, 1996). Roberts et al (2001) have reported that IL15 induces the expression of NKG2D and CD94 (KLRD1; 602894) in jejunal intraepithelial T-cells. When stimulated through the T-cell receptor in the presence of IL15, these cells show enhanced secretion of cytokines and proliferation. </p>
<p>IL15 induces proliferation of mast cells in the absence of functional IL2 receptor components and utilizes a receptor of 60-65 kDa that is distinct from known components of T-cell IL15 receptors. The IL15 receptor on mast cells recruits JAK2 and STAT5, instead of JAK1, JAK3 and STAT3 and STAT5 that are activated in T-cells (see also: Janus kinases, STAT proteins) (Tagaya et al, 1996). </p>
<p>IL15 inhibits apoptosis induced by deprivation of cytokines in activated T-cells. Apoptosis induced by antibodies directed against FAS antigen, or CD3, or dexamethasone, and/or anti-IgM in activated human T-cells and B-cells in vitro is inhibited by IL15 in a manner dependent on RNA synthesis. An IL15-IgG2b fusion protein can suppress lethal multisystem apoptosis induced by anti-FAS antibodies and completely protects from lethal hepatic failure (Bulfone-Paus et al, 1997). </p>
<p>The alpha subunit of the IL15 receptor (IL15RA) is structurally related to the alpha subunit of the IL2 receptor and confers high affinity binding of IL15 to its receptor (Giri et al, 1995; Anderson et al, 1995). Anderson et al (1995) have described 3 differentially spliced human alpha subunits of the IL15 receptor, all of which are all capable of high affinity binding of IL15. Grabstein et al (1994) have reported that IL15 bioactivities are inhibited by antibodies directed against the IL2 receptor-beta chain. Also, IL15 can compete for binding with IL2. IL15 binds to the beta and gamma chains of the IL2 receptor, which are known to be required for ligand internalization and signal transduction (Giri et al, 1994). IL15 does not bind to the alpha subunit of the IL2 receptor. Anderson et al (1995) have cloned the human </p>
<p>High affinity IL15 binding has been observed on many lymphoid cell types, including peripheral blood monocytes, NK-cells and PHA-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CTLL-2 cells appear to express a single class of high affinity receptors for IL15 as determined by the analysis of Scatchard plots. Receptors for IL15 have been observed on fresh human venous endothelial cells, which do not bind IL2. High affinity IL15 receptors are expressed also on stromal cells from bone marrow (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture), fetal liver, and thymic epithelium. </p>
<p>Budagian et al (2004) have reported that a soluble form of the membrane-anchored IL15 receptor-alpha can be generated by cleavage with ADAM17. </p>
<p>Giri et al (1995) have cloned of a distinct murine IL15 receptor-alpha chain, which alone displays a high affinity for IL15. IL15 receptor-alpha is structurally similar to IL2 receptor-alpha. The distribution of IL15 and IL15 receptor-alpha mRNA suggests that IL15 may have biological activities distinct from IL2. </p>
