    <h2>IL2RA</h2>
    
<p>[interleukin-2 receptor-alpha; IL2R-alpha; IL2 receptor-alpha] This is the approved gene symbol for one subunit of the receptor for IL2. The simple designation IL2R [interleukin-2 receptor] is used also. The receptor has been identified originally as TAC antigen. In older publications the has been referred to as TCGFR [T-cell growth factor receptor]. Because of disease associations with polymorphisms of the IL2RA gene, IL2RA is being referred to also as IDDM10. The mouse counterpart of IL2RA is known as Ly43 [lymphocyte antigen 43]. The rat counterpart is OX39. </p>
<p>In the nomenclature of CD antigens the receptor has been given the designation CD25. </p>
<p>The IL2RA gene has been cloned and characterized by Nikaido et al (1983), Leonard et al (1984), Ishida et al (1985), Leonard et al 1985). The IL2 receptor exists in 3 different forms: a high affinity dimer consisting of the alpha subunit IL2RA and the beta subunit (IL2RB), an intermediate affinity monomer (beta subunit), and a low affinity monomer (alpha subunit). IL2RA is not functional in IL2 internalization and signal transduction ((Gnarra et al, 1990). Signalling through the high and intermediate affinity forms requires a heterotrimeric complex formed by association with a gamma subunit (IL2RG; common gamma), which is shared also with receptors for other cytokines (Wang et al, 2005; Stauber DJ et al, 2006). </p>
