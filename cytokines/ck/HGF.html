<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-3-) hepatocyte growth factor </p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>F-TCF (fibroblast tumor cytotoxic factor); HL-60-HGF; HPTA (Hepatopoietin A); SF (scatter factor); TCF (tumor cytotoxic factor). The factor is referred to now frequently as HGF/SF (for Hepatocyte growth factor-scatter factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>HGF was isolated initially from the serum of partially hepatectomised rats. It is produced predominantly in the liver and the pancreas. The liver cells mainly responsible for the synthesis of HGF are Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells. </p>
<p>The synthesis of HGF is stimulated in particular by injuries affecting liver tissues (hepatitis, ischemia, hepatectomy) (see also: inflammation, wound healing). In liver cells the expression of the HGF gene can be repressed strongly by TGF-beta. In human skin fibroblasts the synthesis of HGF is induced by both molecular forms of IL1. </p>
<p>HGF can be isolated also from platelets, kidney, and human serum. HGF is expressed also in human placenta and is found predominantly in trophoblastic tumors. HGF is synthesized also by the HL-60 cell line. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>HGF consists of two subunits held by a disulfide bond. The alpha subunit (69 kDa) has a length of 440 amino acids. The beta subunit (34 kDa) has a length of 234 amino acids. The beta chain of the factor shows approximately 38 % homology at the protein level to the serine protease domain of plasminogen. A variant of the beta chain has been shown to function as a subunit of a hybrid cytokine known as PPBSF [pre-pro-B-cell growth stimulating factor]. </p>
<p>HGF is a glycoprotein; the non-glycosylated factor is also bioactive. The beta-chain of the murine and rat factor display approximately 95 % sequence identity. The murine beta-chain also shows approximately 70 % sequence identity with rabbit HPTA (hepatopoietin A). </p>
<p>Miau et al (1996) have reported the identification and characterization of a novel variant HGF lacking the beta chain from the conditioned medium of stromal cells derived from mouse spleen. Compared to human HGF, it has much lower heparin binding activity. </p>
<p>Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is a variant of HGF that is mitogenic for epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and melanocytes. </p>
<p>A variant of HGF is obtained by alternative splicing. This variant, designated HGF/NK2, is no longer mitogenic and inhibits the HGF induced proliferation of cells. This demonstrates that one and the same gene encodes a growth factor and a natural specific antagonist. The HGF/NK1 isoform, which is shorter than HGF/NK2, possesses modest mitogenic and scattering activity. It possesses partial agonist/antagonist properties. For another truncated form that acts as a specific inhibitor of HGF actions see: HGF/NK4. </p>
<p>dHGF is a naturally occurring splice variant of HGF that lacks a sequence of 5 amino acids in the first kringle domain. The deletion significantly alters the biological activities, solubility, and immunological property of HGF. HGF is more potent than dHGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human aorta smooth muscle cells, and the murine myeloblastic cell line NSF-60. dHGF is more potent than HGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in LLC-PK1 (pig kidney epithelial cells), OK (American opossum kidney epithelial cells), and rat hepatocytes (Shima et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Bell et al (1999) have generated transgenic mice expressing dHGF in the liver under control of the albumin promoter. These mice develop normally, have an enhanced rate of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, and exhibit a threefold higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma beyond 17 months of age. Overexpression of dHGF dramatically accelerates diethyl-nitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis. These tumors arise faster, are significantly larger, more numerous and more invasive than those appearing in non-transgenic littermates. Liver tumors and cultured tumor cell lines from dHGF transgenics express high levels of HGF and its receptor c-met. </p>
<p>Both subunits of HGF are obtained by endoproteolytic cleavage of a common preproprotein of 728 amino acids (approximately 90 kDa) which itself is biologically inactive. The inactive precursor is mostly found in a matrix-associated form. Maturation of the precursor into the active heterodimer takes place in the extracellular environment and results from proteolytic cleavage by urokinase which thus acts as a HGF convertase. </p>
<p>The inactive single-chain precursor of HGF secreted by the producing cells is converted to a biologically active heterodimer by a serine protease, the activity of which is induced in injured liver tissue. A serum serine protease that activates single-chain HGF has been identified (see: HGFA). </p>
<p>An inhibitor of HGF activator (Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1; abbr. HAI-1) has been isolated by Shimomura et al (1997) from the conditioned medium of the human MKN45 stomach carcinoma cell line. The sequence of the cDNA suggests that the inhibitor is a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. A second inhibitor (Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2; abbr. HAI-2) has been isolated from the same cell line by Kawaguchi et al (1997). HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and 2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. Both inhibitors are produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The HGF gene has a length of approximately 70 kb and contains 18 exons. It encodes an mRNA of 6.3 kb. The human gene maps to chromosome 7q11.2-21.1. An IL6 responsive element (see also: gene expression) and a binding site for an IL6-specific transcription factor, C/EBP-beta (see also: IL6) lies in close proximity to the transcription initiation site of the HGF gene. </p>
<p>The murine HGF gene contains a variety of different putative regulatory elements, including four copies of the IL6 responsive element (IL6RE), two potential binding sites for C/EBP-beta, a TGF-beta-1 inhibitory element (TIE element), a cAMP response element (CRE), two estrogen response elements (ERE), a potential vitamin D response element (VDRE) overlapping with a chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) transcription factor binding element, two liver-specific transcription factor (C/EBP) binding sites, and a B-cell and macrophage-specific transcriptional factor binding site (PU.1/ETS). </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The HGF receptor is encoded by the met proto-oncogene on human chromosome 7p11-4. This gene encodes a protein with intrinsic tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in its intracellular domain. The heavy chain is thought to play an important role in the interaction of HGF with its receptor and the light chain is further required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. </p>
<p>The phosphorylated receptor binds phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase which is responsible for post receptor signaling. </p>
<p>Alternative splicing leads to the formation of various isoforms of the receptor. It has been suggested that these isoforms are biologically active and may mediate different biologically responses. The existence of further non-met receptors for HGF has been suggested also. </p>
<p>Ohnishi et al (2012) have reported that the beta chain of HGF utilizes CD206 expressed on Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells as a receptor. Binding of HGF beta chain, to CD206 enhances the ingestion of latex beads, or of apoptotic neutrophils, suggesting that this complex may provide a new pathway for the enhancement of cell clearance systems, which is associated with resolution of inflammation.  </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of HGF are not species-specific. </p>
<p>HGF is a hepatotrophic factor that stimulates the proliferation of hepatocytes in vivo. HGF is the most potent known mitogen for hepatocytes in primary culture. It is one of the major mitogens engaged in liver regeneration processes following partial hepatectomy and other liver injuries (see also: inflammation, wound healing). HGF has been shown also to be involved in the regeneration of kidney tubules. It is a mitogen for kidney epithelial cells. In vitro HGF induces endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate (see also: Scatter factor). </p>
<p>HGF and EGF activities are additive. The mitogenic effect of HGF is enhanced by norepinephine. The biological activity of HGF can be inhibited by suramin. HGF abolishes the inhibitory actions of TGF-beta on cellular proliferation. HGF has been shown also to be one of the priming factors for neutrophils (see also: cell activation). </p>
<p>At present HGF is the only known factor influencing the three-dimensional growth of cells in three-dimensional collagen gels where it leads to the formation of tubular structures in growing epithelial cells. HGF is therefore a multifunctional cytokine that acts as a mitogen, a motogen (see: Scatter factor) and a morphogen, explaining its functions in organogenesis and tissue regeneration. </p>
<p>HGF also shows paracrine activities in that it is produced by kidney mesangial cells and acts on renal epithelial cells. HGF also stimulates the growth of human melanoma cells and murine keratinocytes. The growth of some hepatocellular carcinomas and some human tumor cell lines (B6/F1 melanoma, KB-cells) is inhibited by HGF. </p>
<p>In the rabbit cornea, highly purified HGF promotes neovascularization at subnanomolar concentrations. </p>
<p>HGF synergizes with IL3 and GM-CSF to stimulate colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro and may, therefore, also modulate hematopoiesis. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of HGF have been studied in transgenic mice expressing the factor under the control of albumin regulatory sequences. Hepatocytes of HGF-transgenic mice express increased levels of HGF as an autocrine growth modulator. The experiments also show that HGF increases growth and repair processes when expressed for long periods in the liver: the livers of HGF-transgenic mice recover completely in half the time needed for their normal siblings after partial hepatectomy. Levels of cellular myc and jun mRNA were increased in HGF-transgenic mice. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>A sensitive ELISA assay is available. Other assay systems are based on the activity of HGF as SF (scatter factor). Proliferation of CCL-64 cells induced by HGF has been used also as an assay. The induction of IL11 by HGF in SaOS-2 cells has been used as a bioassay for HGF. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>This factor may be of clinical importance due to its involvement in tissue regeneration following hepatectomy. </p>
