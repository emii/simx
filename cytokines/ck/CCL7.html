<h1>CCL7</h1>

    <h2>CCL7</h2>
    
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 7, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL7 is the new designation of MCP-3 [monocyte chemoattractant protein-3], which is the same as FIC, NC28, or MARC. An older designation is SCYA7 [small inducible cytokine A7]. </p>
<p>CCL7 has been shown to be cleaved by the metalloproteinase MMP-12. Cleavage produces a receptor antagonist (Dean et al, 2008). </p>

    <h2>MCP-3</h2>
    
<p>[monocyte chemoattractant protein-3] called also monocyte chemotactic protein-3 or SCYA7. MCP-3 is encoded by the NC28 cDNA. MCP-3 is a member of the family of CC-Chemokines. The factor has been renamed CCL7. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. </p>
<p>The MCP-3 protein (97 amino acids) sequence shows 74 % identity with MCP-1 and 58 % homology with MCP-2. Secreted MCP-3 differs from MCP-1 in being N-glycosylated. The MCP-3 (SCYA7) gene maps to human chromosome 17 q11.2-q12 close to the erbB2 locus. Human MCP-3 and the mouse MARC gene are porobably homologous. </p>
<p>Both factors specifically attract monocytes, but not neutrophils, in vitro. Intradermal injection of these two proteins into rabbits causes the selective recruitment of monocytes at the site of injection. Levels of MCP-3 mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are increased by IFN-gamma and decreased by IL13. </p>
<p>MCP-3 is produced by a variety of tumor cell lines and regulates protease secretion by macrophages; its production may contribute, therefore, to invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Like some chemokines, and unlike other chemokines, that do, MCP-3 does not possess suppressive activity against immature subsets of myeloid progenitors (see also: hematopoiesis) stimulated to proliferate by multiple growth factors (Broxmeyer et al, 1999). </p>
<p>MCP-3 binds to a receptor designated D6. MCP-3 also binds to CCR10, and CCR1 (Ben-Baruch et al, 1995). </p>
<p>McQuibban et al (2000) have pointed out the catalytic importance of substrate-binding exosites outside the catalytic domain of the metalloproteinase MMP-2. They have identified the chemokine MCP-3 as a physiological substrate of MMP-2 that binds to the hemopexin domain. Cleaved MCP-3 binds to CC-Chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3, but no longer induces calcium fluxes or promotes chemotaxis, and instead acts as a general chemokine antagonist that dampens inflammation. </p>
