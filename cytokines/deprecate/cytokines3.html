<h2>CCL11</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 11, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL11 is the new designation of Eotaxin. An older designation is SCYA11 [small inducible cytokine A11]. </p>
<p>Yang et al (2003) have shown that CCL11 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. </p>

<h2>Eotaxin</h2>
<p>This protein of 73 amino acids has been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage of guinea pigs used as a model of allergic inflammation. The factor belongs to the platelet factor-4 family (see: PF4) of Chemokines. It exhibits homology of 53 % with human MCP-1, 44 % with guinea pig MCP-1, 31 % with human MIP-1-alpha, and 26 % with human RANTES. Eotaxin is 60 % identical with MCP-4 (Monocyte chemotactic protein-4). The gene symbol is SCYA11. The factor is being referred to also as Eotaxin-1 (following the identification of related factors Eotaxin-2, Eotaxin-3) and has been renamed CCL11. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. </p>
<p>The protein sequence of human eotaxin is 66 % identical with human MCP-1, and 60 % identical with guinea pig eotaxin. For a structurally less related but functionally related factor see also: Eotaxin-2. </p>
<p>Eotaxin induces substantial accumulation of eosinophils at a 1-2 pmol dose in the skin without significantly affecting the accumulation of neutrophils. Eotaxin is a potent stimulator of both guinea pig and human eosinophils in vitro. The factor appears to share a binding site with RANTES on guinea pig eosinophils. </p>
<p>Recombinant human eotaxin induces a calcium flux response in normal human eosinophils, but not in neutrophils or monocytes. The response cannot be desensitized by pretreatment of eosinophils with other CC-Chemokines, suggesting a unique receptor. In basophils Eotaxin induces higher levels of chemotactic response than RANTES but it has only a marginal effect on either histamine release or leukotriene C 4 generation. </p>
<p>The receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor selectively expressed in human eosinophils (see also: CCR3). </p>
<p>Ponath et al (1996) have described a receptor on eosinophils, designated CKR3, that is distinct from the known receptors for Chemokines designated CCR1 and CCR2. CKR3 is not expressed on other types of leukocytes. The CKR3 receptor also binds RANTES and MCP-3 with high affinity, but not other CC-Chemokines or or CXC-Chemokines. Murine B-cell lymphoma cells engineered to express CKR3 migrate in response to eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3, but not to any other chemokines. A viroceptor encoded by equine herpesvirus 2 (see: EHV-2 E1 orf) has been shown to bind Eotaxin. </p>
<p>Like some chemokines, and unlike other chemokines, that do, Eotaxin does not possess suppressive activity against immature subsets of myeloid progenitors (see also: hematopoiesis) stimulated to proliferate by multiple growth factors (Broxmeyer et al (1999). </p>
<p>Bartels et al (1996) have demonstrated the presence of eotaxin sequence variants and of low constitutive eotaxin mRNA expression in human dermal fibroblasts, which is upregulated by IL1-alpha or TNF-alpha within 6 hrs and modulated by IFN-gamma. Induction by IL1-alpha is transient while long-term stimulation with TNF-alpha results in a further increase of eotaxin mRNA. </p>
<p>This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CCL11. For other proteins/peptides with functions in innate immunity and/or antimicrobial activities see also: Innate immunity defense peptides Dictionary.  </p>

<h2>CCL2</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this particular group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>This factor is the same as GDCF, HC11, LDCF, MCAF, MCP, MCP-1, SMC-CF, TDCF, TSG-8. A previous designation is SCYA2 [small inducible cytokine A2]. </p>
<p>CCL2 has been shown to be cleaved by the metalloproteinase MMP-12. Cleavage produces a receptor antagonist (Dean et al, 2008). </p>

<h2>MCP-1</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> (-1-) monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 </p>
<p>called also monocyte chemotactic protein-1. MCP-1 is encoded by the human JE gene at chromosome 17q11.2-q21.1, known also as SCYA2 (small inducible cytokine A2) (the factor has been renamed CCL2; see also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature of this factor). Antibodies directed against murine MCP-1 cross-react with the human factor. The human factor is 49 amino acids shorter at the aminoterminus than the rodent factor. </p>
<p>MCP-1 belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines. It is identical with MCAF (monocyte chemotactic and activating factor), MCP (monocyte chemotactic protein), HC11, SMC-CF (smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor), LDCF (lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor), GDCF (glioma-derived monocyte chemotactic factor), TDCF (tumor-derived chemotactic factors) and P6. MCP-1 shows a high degree of homology with MARC protein. For a bioactive peptide fragment of MCP-1 that inhibits the chemotactic response of cells elicited by a wide range of chemokines see: peptide 3. </p>
<p>Weber et al (1996) have reported that MCP-1(2-76), an MCP-1 variant with a deletion of the aminoterminal amino acid, is active on eosinophils, whereas the parent factor is not. The deletion mutant has a markedly decreased activity on basophils as compared to the parent molecule. MCP-1(3-76) is completely inactive on eosinophils and basophils. MCP-1(4-76) and MCP-1(5-76) are active on both cells, whereas MCP-1(6-76), MCP-1(7-76), MCP-1(8-76), MCP-1(9-76), MCP-1(10-76) are inactive. </p>
<p>A glycosylated natural form of MCP-1/JE of 30 kDa has been found to be secreted into the conditioned medium by a medullary-type murine thymic epithelial cell line (MTEC1). The 30 kDa glycosylated form of MCP-1 shows lower specific chemotactic activity for both lymphocytes and monocytes than the 6-7 kDa unglycosylated form of MCP-1. </p>
<p>MCP-1 is expressed by monocytes, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, glomerular mesangial cell, osteoblastic cells, and human pulmonary type 2 like epithelial cells in culture. It is constitutively produced by the human glioma U-105MG cell line. MCP-1 mRNA is induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and IL1, but not by IL2, TNF, or IFN-gamma. In mesangial cells the synthesis and release of MCP-1 is rapidly induced by IgG complexes, but not monomeric IgG or F(ab')2 fragments of IgG. </p>
<p>MCP-1 is chemotactic for monocytes but not neutrophils. Maximal induction of migration is observed at a concentration of 10 ng/mL (see also: Chemotaxis). Point mutations have been described at two amino acid positions, which alter the factor so that it is then also chemotactic for neutrophils. </p>
<p>Elevated levels of MCP-1 are observed in atherosclerotic plaques that are rich in macrophages. The factor activates the tumoricidal activity of monocytes and macrophages in vivo. It regulates the expression of cell surface antigens (CD11c, CD11b) and the expression of cytokines (IL1, IL6). MCP-1 is a potent activator of human basophils, inducing degranulation and the release of histamines. In basophils activated by IL3, IL5 or GM-CSF MCP-1 enhances the synthesis of leukotriene C4. </p>
<p>IL1, TNF-alpha, PDGF, TGF-beta, and LIF induce the synthesis of MCP-1 in human articular chondrocytes, which may thus play an active role in the initiation and progression of degenerative and inflammatory arthropathies by promoting influx and cell activation of monocytes in synovial joints (see also: inflammation). </p>
<p>MCP-1 has been shown to exhibit biological activities other than Chemotaxis. It can induce the proliferation and activation of killer cells known as CHAK (CC-Chemokine-activated killer), which are similar to cells activated by IL2 (see also: LAK cells). </p>
<p>Two MCP-1-specific receptors have been cloned which signal in response to nanomolar concentrations of MCP-1. The two receptors differ in their carboxyl tails as a result of alternative splicing. They are related closely to the receptor for the Chemokines MIP-1-alpha and RANTES. MCP-1 also binds to a receptor designated D6. MCP-1 also binds to CCR10. MCP-1 has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. See also: S19 ribosomal protein. </p>
<p>The orphan receptor L-CCR has been suggested to function as an MCP-1 receptor in glial cells. </p>

<h2>MCAF</h2>
<p>[monocyte chemotactic and activating factor] This factor of 15 kDa (76 amino acids) is called also MCF (macrophage chemotactic factor) or TSG-8 (see: TSG genes). </p>
<p>MCAF is produced by monocytes and macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, astrocytes. and various tumor cells lines. The factor was detected initially during the purification of IL8. Inducers for the synthesis of MCAF are IL1, which also prolongs the biological half life of M-CSF mRNA, TNF, PDGF, phytohemagglutinin, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, hydroxy urea, double-stranded RNA and viruses. Glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of MCAF. </p>
<p>MCAF belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (subgroup of CC-Chemokines). The gene symbol is SCYA2 and the new designation is CCL2. </p>
<p>MCAF is encoded by the JE gene on human chromosome 17. This factor is identical with MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), MCP (monocyte chemotactic protein), HC11, SMC-CF (smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor), LDCF (lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor), GDCF (glioma-derived monocyte chemotactic factor), TDCF (tumor-derived chemotactic factors). See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature of this factor. </p>
<p>MCAF is a strong chemoattractant for monocytes (see also: Chemotaxis), it increases the production of reactive oxygen species and enhances the release of N-acetyl-beta-glucuronaminidase. MCAF promotes the cytostatic activities of cultured human monocytes against a number of tumor cells lines. In basophils MCAF is one of the most potent cytokines inducing the release of histamines. This specific activity is antagonized by another cytokine, RANTES. </p>
<p>MCAF from keratinocytes may be important in the regulation of cutaneous trafficking of monocytes and may be responsible also for the recruitment of Langerhans cells and dermal dendrocytes, which share many phenotypic features with monocytes and macrophages, to their anatomic locations in skin. MCAF (and IL8) may play a role also in growth regulation and spreading of melanomas. </p>
<p>The biological activities of MCAF are mediated by a specific receptor. A second species of receptors also appears to bind MCAF and MIP-1-alpha and MIP-1-beta (see: MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein). </p>
<p>Ye et al (1997) have constructed a fusion protein consisting of GM-CSF and MCAF. The recombinant human fusion protein can sustain the growth of GM-CSF dependent cell line TF-1 and is chemotactic for monocytes. In vitro the fusion protein activates monocytes to inhibit the growth of several human tumor cell lines. The fusion protein is more effective in inducing cytotoxicity of monocytes than GM-CSF or MCAF alone or than a combination of GM-CSF and MCAF. The fusion protein also completely suppresses tumor formation in nude mice. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>Akahoshi et al (1995) have determined plasma MCAF in patients with end-stage renal disease. Increased levels of plasma MCAF may promote the activation of monocytes in patients with end-stage renal disease. </p>

<h2>CCL27</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 27, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 27] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL27 is the new designation of ALP, CTACK [cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine], ESkine, ILC [interleukin-11 receptor alpha-locus chemokine; IL11Ralpha-locus chemokine], PESKY, skinkine. An older designation is SCYA27 [small inducible cytokine A27]. </p>

<h2>ALP</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) This murine protein, designated ALP for its amino terminal peptide sequence, belongs to the group of CC-Chemokines to which it is distantly related (37 % identity with murine Exodus-1). If differs from these chemokines by a unique amino terminal peptide sequence. Unlike other members of the group of CC-Chemokines ALP is expressed preferentially in testis, heart, and liver (Hromas et al, 1999). </p>
<p>The factor has been renamed CCL27. The gene symbol is SCYA27. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. CCL27 is the new designation of CTACK (cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine), ESkine, ILC (interleukin-11 receptor alpha-locus chemokine; IL11Ralpha-locus chemokine), PESKY, skinkine. </p>

<h2>CTACK</h2>
<p>[cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine] The factor has been renamed CCL27. The gene symbol is SCYA27. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. CCL27 is the new designation of ALP, ESkine, ILC (interleukin-11 receptor alpha-locus chemokine; IL11Ralpha-locus chemokine), PESKY, skinkine </p>
<p>This protein of 112 amino acids is one of the CC-Chemokines. Human and mouse CTACK appear to be expressed specifically in skin (mouse epidermis and human keratinocytes). The factor is produced constitutively by keratinocytes. Stimulation TNF-alpha and IL1-beta also induces expression. CTACK selectively attracts circulating memory T-cells specifically expressing the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen CLA. The receptor is CCR10. </p>

<h2>CCL4</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL4 is the new designation of ACT-2. This factor is identical with 744.1, G26, H400, HC21, LAG-1, MIP-1-beta, and SIS-gamma. A previous designation is SCYA4 [small inducible cytokine A4]. </p>
<p>The human genome contains two paralogous genes for the CCL4 chemokine, represented by ACT-2 and LAG-1. These genes are highly homologous, but encode slightly different proteins and also are regulated and expressed differentially. This also suggests that the two genes may not have identical activities. Monocytes express predominantly ACT-2. Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and LAG-1 (Lu et al, 2004). </p>
<p>The protein is known mainly for its activity as a chemotactic cytokine but may have a potential role in host defense as a direct antiviral agent. CCL4 has been reported to show a significant direct antiviral activity against HSV-1. It binds to HSV-1 virions via envelope glycoprotein gB and is capable of generating pores in the envelope of HSV-1 (Nakayama et al, 2006). </p>

<h2>ACT-2</h2>
<p>[Immune activation gene-2] ACT-2 is known also as G26, pAT744, LAG-1, and MIP-1-beta (macrophage inflammatory protein see: MIP). The new designation is CCL4. </p>
<p>The human ACT-2 gene, designated SCYA4 (see also: SCY family of cytokines), maps to chromosome 17q21-q23 (Napolitano et al, 1991). Studies of sequence homology and genome organization have shown that ACT-2 belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines. </p>
<p>ACT-2 is a factor secreted by T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and various tumor cell lines, following cell activation by mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin, bacterial endotoxins or Staphylococcus aureus (Lipes et al, 1988). The synthesis of ACT-2 is stimulated also by IL2, while glucocorticoids, TGF-beta and CsA (cyclosporin A) inhibit the synthesis. </p>
<p>In rats, the subcutaneous injection of the factor precipitates local inflammatory reactions characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils. </p>
<p>The human genome contains two genes for the CCL4 chemokine, represented by ACT-2 and LAG-1. These genes are highly homologous, but encode slightly different proteins and also are regulated and expressed differentially. This also suggests that the two genes may not have identical activities. Monocytes express predominantly ACT-2. Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and LAG-1 (Lu et al, 2004). </p>

<h2>CCL5</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL5 has been described as RANTES, EoCP-1 [Eosinophil chemotactic polypeptide-1], and SIS-delta. The protein has been referred to also as TCP228 [T-cell-specific protein p228]. An older designation is SCYA5 [small inducible cytokine A5]. </p>
<p>The protein is known mainly for its activity as a chemotactic cytokine but may have a potential role in host defense as a direct antiviral agent. CCL5 has been reported to show a significant direct antiviral activity against HSV-1. It binds to HSV-1 virions via envelope glycoprotein gB and is capable of generating pores in the envelope of HSV-1 (Nakayama et al, 2006). Yang et al (2003) have shown that CCL5 is active against Gram-negative Escherichia coli. </p>

<h2>RANTES</h2>
<p>[regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed, and presumably secreted] This factor of 8 kDa is called also SIS-delta (see: SIS family of cytokines), SCYA5 (see: SCY family of cytokines), and EoCP-1 (eosinophil chemotactic polypeptide). RANTES has been renamed CCL5 (see also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature of this factor). Based on the presence of a conserved three-dimensional motif and direct microbicidal activity, RANTES has been classified as a kinocidin (microbicidal chemokine). The protein has been referred to also as TCP228 [T-cell-specific protein p228]. For a synthesized N-terminally modified analog see also: P2-RANTES.  </p>
<p>At the protein level murine RANTES shows 90 % homology with human RANTES. RANTES belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (subgroup of CC-Chemokines). The human gene maps to chromosome 17q11. 2-q12 in the vicinity of other cytokine genes belonging to the group of Chemokines. 3-68 RANTES (RANTES (3-68)), which lacks two N-terminal amino acids, is generated from full-length RANTES (1-68 RANTES) (RANTES (1-68)) by cleavage with soluble CD26. 4-68 RANTES (RANTES (4-68)), which lacks three N-terminal amino acids, is generated from full-length RANTES by cleavage with unidentified enzymes associated with monocytes and neutrophils. 4-68 RANTES has reduced chemotactic activities and HIV suppressive activities (Lim et al, 2005). </p>
<p>RANTES is expressed by an early response gene. The synthesis of RANTES is induced by TNF-alpha and IL1-alpha (see: IL1) but not by TGF-beta, IFN-gamma and IL6. </p>
<p>RANTES is produced by circulating T-cells and T-cell clones in culture but not by any T-cell lines tested so far. The expression of RANTES is inhibited following stimulation of T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>RANTES is chemotactic for T-cells, human eosinophils and basophils (see also: Chemotaxis) and plays an active role in recruiting leukocytes into inflammatory sites. RANTES also activates eosinophils to release, for example, eosinophilic cationic protein. It changes the density of eosinophils and makes them hypodense, which is thought to represent a state of generalized cell activation and is associated most often with diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. RANTES also is a potent activator of oxidative metabolism specific for eosinophils. </p>
<p>RANTES increases the adherence of monocytes to endothelial cells. It selectively supports the migration (see also: Motogenic cytokines) of monocytes and T-lymphocytes expressing the cell surface markers CD4 and UCHL1. These cells are thought to be pre-stimulated T-helper cells with memory T-cell functions. RANTES activates human basophils from some select basophil donors and causes the release of histamines (see also: HRF, histamine releasing factors). On the other hand RANTES can also inhibit the release of histamines from basophils induced by several cytokines, including one of the most potent histamine inducers, MCAF. </p>
<p>RANTES has been shown recently to exhibit biological activities other than Chemotaxis. It can induce the proliferation and activation of killer cells known as CHAK (CC-Chemokine-activated killer), which are similar to cells activated by IL2 (see: LAK cells). </p>
<p>RANTES is expressed by human synovial fibroblasts and may participate, therefore, in the ongoing inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>High affinity receptors for RANTES (approximately 700 binding sites/cell; Kd = 700 picoM) have been identified on the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which responds to RANTES in Chemotaxis and calcium mobilization assays. The chemotactic response of THP-1 cells to RANTES is markedly inhibited by preincubation with MCAF (monocyte chemotactic and activating factor) or MIP-1-alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein). Binding of RANTES to monocytic cells is competed for by MCAF and MIP-1-alpha. </p>
<p>Another RANTES receptor is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, designated CCR1. It shows approximately 33 % identity with receptors for IL8 and may be the human homolog of the US28 open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus. For another viral RANTES receptor homolog see also: ECRF-3. RANTES has been shown also to bind to one of the chemokine receptors designated CCR5. RANTES has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p>Proudfoot et al (1996) have reported that the extension of recombinant human RANTES by a single residue at the amino terminus (Met-RANTES) is sufficient to produce a potent and selective antagonist, which acts as a potent antagonist of RANTES and MIP-1-alpha, both of which share the same receptor. CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>It has been observed that antibodies to RANTES can dramatically inhibit the cellular infiltration associated with experimental mesangioproliferative nephritis. In addition, RANTES appears to be expressed highly in human renal allografts undergoing cellular rejection. </p>
<p>A chemically modified form of RANTES (Aminooxypentane-linked RANTES or AOP-RANTES) has been shown to act as an antagonist for the CCR5 receptor of chemokines and to have the ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection by blocking CCR5, which serves as a coreceptor for virus entry. </p>
<p>Cocchi et al (1995) have identified MIP-1-alpha, MIP-1-beta, and RANTES as the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8(+) T-cells. </p>
<p>This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CCL5. For other proteins/peptides with functions in innate immunity and/or antimicrobial activities see also: Innate immunity defense peptides Dictionary.  </p>

<h2>CCL7</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 7, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL7 is the new designation of MCP-3 [monocyte chemoattractant protein-3], which is the same as FIC, NC28, or MARC. An older designation is SCYA7 [small inducible cytokine A7]. </p>
<p>CCL7 has been shown to be cleaved by the metalloproteinase MMP-12. Cleavage produces a receptor antagonist (Dean et al, 2008). </p>

<h2>MCP-3</h2>
<p>[monocyte chemoattractant protein-3] called also monocyte chemotactic protein-3 or SCYA7. MCP-3 is encoded by the NC28 cDNA. MCP-3 is a member of the family of CC-Chemokines. The factor has been renamed CCL7. See also: SCY family of cytokines for a systematic nomenclature. </p>
<p>The MCP-3 protein (97 amino acids) sequence shows 74 % identity with MCP-1 and 58 % homology with MCP-2. Secreted MCP-3 differs from MCP-1 in being N-glycosylated. The MCP-3 (SCYA7) gene maps to human chromosome 17 q11.2-q12 close to the erbB2 locus. Human MCP-3 and the mouse MARC gene are porobably homologous. </p>
<p>Both factors specifically attract monocytes, but not neutrophils, in vitro. Intradermal injection of these two proteins into rabbits causes the selective recruitment of monocytes at the site of injection. Levels of MCP-3 mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are increased by IFN-gamma and decreased by IL13. </p>
<p>MCP-3 is produced by a variety of tumor cell lines and regulates protease secretion by macrophages; its production may contribute, therefore, to invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. </p>
<p>Like some chemokines, and unlike other chemokines, that do, MCP-3 does not possess suppressive activity against immature subsets of myeloid progenitors (see also: hematopoiesis) stimulated to proliferate by multiple growth factors (Broxmeyer et al, 1999). </p>
<p>MCP-3 binds to a receptor designated D6. MCP-3 also binds to CCR10, and CCR1 (Ben-Baruch et al, 1995). </p>
<p>McQuibban et al (2000) have pointed out the catalytic importance of substrate-binding exosites outside the catalytic domain of the metalloproteinase MMP-2. They have identified the chemokine MCP-3 as a physiological substrate of MMP-2 that binds to the hemopexin domain. Cleaved MCP-3 binds to CC-Chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3, but no longer induces calcium fluxes or promotes chemotaxis, and instead acts as a general chemokine antagonist that dampens inflammation. </p>

<h2>CLEC11-A</h2>

<h2>Stem%20cell%20growth%20factor</h2>
<p>abbr. SCGF (a term with multiple meanings). Note: in some references (not only the older one) the term may apply to SCF [stem cell factor], which is an entirely different factor. </p>
<p>The cDNA for human SCGF encodes a 29 kDa polypeptide (245 amino acids) without N-linked glycosylation (Hiraoka et al, 1997). Human, murine and rat SCGF display approximately 85 % identity at the amino acid level. Don't confuse with SCF, which in the older references may also occur as stem cell growth factor. </p>
<p>Human SCGF-alpha [stem cell growth factor-alpha] is a protein of 323 amino acids (Mio et al, 1998). The shorter form (245 amino acids) is characterized by a deletion within a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain and has been termed SCGF-beta [stem cell growth factor-beta] (Mio et al, 1998). SCGF has been identified as a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. The human gene maps to chromosome 19q13.3 close to the genes encoding flk-2 and IL11. SCGF has been found to be identical with LSLCL [lymphocytic secreted long form of C-type lectin]. The approved gene symbol is CLEC11A [C-type lectin domain family member 11A]. An alternative designation is CLECSF3 [C-type lectin domain superfamily member 3]. </p>
<p>The factor is found in the conditioned medium of the human KPB-M15 myeloid cell line but is not produced by a variety of cell lines established from T-cells or myeloid cells tested (Hiraoka et al, 1987, 1989). Perrin et al (2001) have reported that the factor is concentrated in the cytoplasm of immature neutrophils but not in myeloblasts nor in mature neutrophils. The factor is found also in human placental conditioned medium. Expression of SCGF mRNA appears to be restricted to myeloid cells and fibroblasts. SCGF transcripts are detected in spleen, thymus, appendix, bone marrow and fetal liver. Hiraoka et al (2001) have demonstrated specific expression of SCGF mRNA around skeletal tissues, particularly in bone marrow cells, proliferating chondrocytes, the perichondrium and periosteum, but little expression in resting or hypertrophic chondrocytes. The factor is expressed by normal stromal cells under conditions that promote B-lymphopoiesis (Witte et al, 1993). </p>
<p>SCGF acts as a species-specific growth factor for primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. Hiraoka et al (2001) have reported that recombinant SCGF-alpha alone does not stimulate colony formation, but small cluster-formation from human CD34(+) lineage marker-negative cells cells. It promotes growth of erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colonies in the primary culture with erythropoietin and GM-CSF or G-CSF, respectively, and further supports progenitor cells of granulocytes and macrophages in a short-term liquid culture. SCGF-alpha suppresses erythroid bursts stimulated by SCF. SCGF-alpha synergizes with IL3 and flt-3 ligand to enhance growth of colonies containing granulocyte/macrophage but is not synergistic with those factors inducing ex vivo expansion of granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells (see also: Colony formation assay, BMC). Yuan et al (2006) have reported that the long isoform of SCGF, unlike human SCGF-beta, acts on murine bone marrow CFU-GM progenitor cells and thus does not show strict species specificity. </p>
<p>Gehling et al (2000) have reported that SCGF together with VEGF allows differentiation of endothelial cells from human progenitor cells. </p>
<p>Ito et al (2003) have reported that serum concentrations of SCGF can be used as an indicator of hematopoietic recovery following stem cell transplantation. </p>

<h2>CSF</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) cell scattering factors. See: Motogenic cytokines. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) colony stimulating factors </p>
<p>colony stimulating activities, also abbr. CSA. </p>
<p>This term goes back to experiments carried out in the 60ies, which attempted to grow colonies of bone marrow cells immobilized in soft agar or methyl cellulose (see also: Colony formation assay). It was found that Feeder cell layers and also the supplementation of the growth media with conditioned medium considerably promoted colony growth, suggesting the existence of colony stimulating factors secreted by the cells. </p>
<p>While hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis) could be maintained only for short periods of time in the absence of such factors, their presence allowed the development of colonies containing erythroid cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and megakaryocytes (see also: CFU, colony-forming unit). The biochemical analysis of various activities stimulating colony formation supporting the growth and development of these cell types revealed that there existed many different and distinct factors of this sort. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors belong to the group of regulatory proteins and peptides known as cytokines. Many of these factors are either N- or O-glycosylated. Glycosylation has been shown to enhance the solubility, stability and resistance to proteolytic enzymes. It does not appear to be required for the full spectrum of biological activities of these factors (see also: Recombinant cytokines). The genes encoding many of the human colony stimulating factors have been cloned and mapped. Some of the genes are in close vicinity but they do not show great homology among each other with the exception of some conserved regions. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors are produced by many different cell types, including, for example, B-lymphocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, bonemarrow stromal cells, T-lymphocytes. They are synthesized as precursor molecules containing a classical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of approximately 25-32 amino acids (see also: gene expression). </p>
<p>The secreted factors have an extremely high specific biological activity (10**8 - 10**9 units/mg protein) and are, therefore, active at very low concentrations (1-100 pM). These factors are absolutely required for the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The concentrations required for mere maintenance of viability are usually orders of magnitude lower than those required to induce cell proliferation or to elicit specific functional activities of the cells. </p>
<p>The names of the individual factors usually indicate the cell types that respond to these factors. The classical colony stimulating factors include M-CSF (specific for macrophages), G-CSF (specific for granulocytes), GM-CSF (specific for macrophages and granulocytes), IL3 (multifunctional) and MEG-CSA (specific for megakaryocytes). G-CSF and M-CSF are lineage-specific while GM-CSF and IL3 are multifunctional hematopoietic growth factors acting on earlier stages of differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Some of the biological activities of colony stimulating factors are concentration-dependent, i.e., biological activities may differ depending upon whether low or high concentrations of the corresponding factors act on the cells. In addition, the activities of many of these factors can be synergised and antagnoized by other factors. </p>
<p>Factors such as Epo, which is involved in erythropoiesis, but also most of the factors known as Interleukins, are not classified as colony stimulating factors. In combination with colony-forming factors they constitute the group of so-called hematopoietins (hematopoietic growth factors). </p>
<p>The synthesis of colony stimulating factors can be stimulated by immunological reactions and products of infectious agents. In some cell types their synthesis can be stimulated by a factor of up to 1000. The induction of synthesis may be direct or a consequence of the activity of other hematopoietic factors. The synthesis of IL1, for example, is induced by bacterial endotoxins or foreign antigens, and IL1, in turn, is capable of stimulating the synthesis of various colony stimulating factors. </p>
<p>Colony stimulating factors may act as differentiation factors initiating the irreversible terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Colony stimulating factors also induce the synthesis of many other growth factors and play an important role in the maintenance of membrane integrity and cell viability. The proliferation of mature cells is usually not influenced by these factors, they may, however, prolong their life span. Apart from their actions on a number of hematopoietic cell types colony stimulating factors also influence other cell types. </p>
<p>The stimulation of hematopoietic cells in particular by colony stimulating factors is the basis of their clinical use in patients suffering from diverse forms of hematopoietic disorders. The use of molecular biological techniques, culminating in the cloning and expression of the genes encoding the colony stimulating factors has been instrumental in this development. Most of these factors are now available in highly purified form and in sufficient amounts allowing an assessment of their therapeutical efficacy and their use in the clinic (see also: Recombinant cytokines. </p>
<p>The use of these mediators opens ways of reconstituting aberrant hematopoietic processes in a physiological manner. This includes more or less all varieties of disorders, which are characterized either by an insufficient maturation of blood cells or by a reduced production of leukocytes. The fact that different cell types vary in their responses to individual colony stimulating factors can be used to expand differentially defined populations of progenitor cells. On the one hand, these factors can be used to correct chemotherapy induced cytopenias. Colony stimulating factors can be used to counteract cytopenia-related predisposition to infections and hemorrhages. Since these factors are capable also of influencing the growth cycle of many malignant cell types, many of them showing at least tumoricidal activities, colony stimulating factors may be used also in the directed treatment of various cancers either alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs. </p>
<p>The major advantage of treatments involving the use of colony stimulating factors is certainly the more or less physiological reconstitution of hematopoietic processes. So far there are no indications that treatments with these factors lead to an exhaustion of the normal stem cell population in the bone marrow or to the proliferation on non-myeloid tumors (see also: hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p>A novel concept is the so-called peripheral stem cell separation. This technique involves the expansion of peripheral stem cells by in vivo pretreatment with suitable colony stimulating factors and their subsequent collection. These cells can be re-infused at a later time to normalize blood parameters, following, for example, extensive courses of drug treatment. </p>
<p>Available colony stimulating factors can be used in different clinical stettings and the entire spectrum of clinical indications is only just now emerging. </p>

<h2>CSF-1</h2>
<p>[Colony stimulating factor-1] This factor was described initially as a growth factor that promotes the development of colonies containing macrophages in a colony formation assay (see also: CSF for general information about colony stimulating factors). </p>
<p>It is identical with M-CSF. A splice variant of CSF-1 has been named CSF-4. A binding factor for M-CSF has been found in the serum from a patient in remission from lymphoma (see: CSF-1 binding factor). </p>

<h2>M-CSF</h2>
<p>[macrophage colony stimulating factor; monocyte colony stimulating factor] </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>CSA (colony stimulating activity); CSF (colony stimulating factor without any further designation; especially in the older literature); CSF-1 (colony stimulating factor-1); CSF-HU (Urinary colony stimulating factor) </p>
<p>KPB-M15-CSA (KPB-M15 derived colony stimulating activity) Lanimostim (in some databanks) </p>
<p>L-cell CSF (L-cell colony stimulating factor); LSF (leukemogenic stromal factor); MAF-J6-1; MGF (macrophage growth factor); MGI-1M (macrophage-granulocyte inducer); XS cell growth factor. See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>M-CSF is produced by monocytes, granulocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. After cell activation, B-cells and T-cells and also a number of tumor cell lines are capable also of synthesizing this factor. M-CSF has been found to be synthesized by uterine epithelial cells in vivo. The factor is found also in human urine. </p>
<p>The synthesis of M-CSF can be induced by IL1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF and PDGF. Prostaglandins, glucocorticoids, TGF-beta and substances that raise intracellular levels of cAMP inhibit the synthesis of M-CSF. </p>
<p>The murine op allele (see: op/op mice) is caused by a mutation of the M-CSF gene. These mice are characterized by a complete absence of this factor. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>M-CSF is a homodimeric glycoprotein the subunits of which are linked by disulfide bonds. The sugar moiety is not required for the full spectrum of biological activities. Different molecular forms of M-CSF with lengths of 256 (M-CSF-alpha), 554 (M-CSF-beta) and 438 (M-CSF-gamma) amino acids have been described. They arise by translation of alternatively spliced mRNAs. Another splice variant is called CSF-4. For deletion variants see: LSF (leukemogenic stromal factor). </p>
<p>M-CSF-beta is a secreted protein that does not occur in a membrane-bound form. M-CSF-alpha is expressed as an integral membrane protein that is slowly released by proteolytic cleavage. The membrane-bound form of M-CSF can interact with receptors on near-by cells and therefore mediates specific cell-to-cell contacts (see: juxtacrine). Some high-molecular weight forms of murine M-CSF have been described. These forms are complexed with proteoglycan (see: PG-M-CSF). </p>
<p>A comparison of the primary sequence of M-CSF with those of the other human colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF, G-CSF) reveals that the three factors are not related to each other. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human M-CSF has a length of approximately 20 kb and contains ten exons. The gene was originally thought to be located to human chromosome 5q33 in close proximity to genes encoding other Hematopoietic growth factors GM-CSF, IL3, IL4 and IL5. The gene has now been reassigned to chromosome 1p13-p212 in the vicinity to the amylase genes. The murine M-CSF gene has been shown to be the site of the mutation in a form of osteopetrosis (see: op/op). The rat gene tl (toothless), likewise, causes osteopetrosis, and is due to a mutation in the M-CSF gene. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The biological activities of M-CSF are mediated by a receptor of 165 kDa encoded by a gene mapping to human chromosome 5q33. 3 (see also: 5q minus syndrome). The M-CSF receptor is identical with the proto-oncogene fms. It has been renamed CD115. The gene is approximately 800 bp from the PDGF receptor gene. The expression of both receptor genes is probably controlled by common regulatory sequences since the M-CSF receptor gene does not possess regulatory regions of its own. </p>
<p>The receptor is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular ligand-binding domain of 512 amino acids, an intramembrane domain of 25 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 435 amino acids encoding a bipartite tyrosine kinase interrupted by a so-called kinase insert (see also: PTK, protein tyrosine kinase). </p>
<p>Binding of the ligand leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptor. Ligand/receptor complexes are internalized by the cell and degraded. Effects associated with ligand binding include the stimulation of protein biosynthesis, glucose transport, and Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Intracellular signaling also involves a G-protein. After binding of M-CSF to its receptor the receptor associates with non-receptor protein kinases called fyn and yes, which appear to mediate some of the intracellular signals. </p>
<p>M-CSF circulating in the serum is mainly removed by binding to macrophage receptors and subsequent internalization and degradation. A binding factor for M-CSF has been found in the serum from a patient in remission from lymphma (see: CSF-1 binding factor). </p>
<p>Experiments with a functional M-CSF receptor gene have been used to study the plasticity of B-lymphoid progenitor cells. Murine cells develop into which a cloned receptor gene was introduced can differentiate into macrophages in the presence of M-CSF. Similar results are obtained by introduction of the myc oncogene and the raf oncogene into normal bone marrow cells using a retrovirus vector. This phenomenon is known as lineage switching. The switching process can be inhibited by IL7 in these cells. Approximately 5-10 % of all acute leukemias are biphenotypic and express markers of lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. These leukemias cannot be assigned to a distinct lineage and may be the result of transformation of biphenotypic progenitor cells. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human M-CSF is active in mouse and rat cells. The murine factor is active in rat cells but inactive in human cells. </p>
<p>M-CSF was isolated initially as a factor stimulating the growth of colonies of macrophages and granulocytes in soft agar cultures (see also: Colony formation assay). M-CSF influences the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into macrophages but mainly the growth survival and differentiation of monocytes. In combination with another colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF, one observes the phenomenon of synergistic suppression, i.e., the combination of these two factors leads to a partial suppression of the generation of macrophage-containing cell colonies </p>
<p>M-CSF is a specific factor in that the proliferation inducing activity is more or less restricted to the macrophage lineage. M-CSF also is a potent stimulator of functional activities of monocytes. </p>
<p>In normal human macrophages M-CSF induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (see: ADCC). </p>
<p>In monocytes and macrophages M-CSF induces the synthesis of IL1, G-CSF, IFN, TNF, plasminogen activator, thromboplastin, prostaglandins and thromboxanes and also oxidative metabolism. M-CSF synergises with IL1, IL3 and IL6 in the stimulation of proliferation and the differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells into macrophages. </p>
<p>Since M-CSF is synthesized also by uterine epithelial cells it may be involved in the maintenance of normal placental functions, acting on the decidua and trophoblasts. </p>
<p>In experimental animals M-CSF reduces plasma levels of cholesterol. </p>
<p>In humans M-CSF enhances counts of monocytes and leads to an expansion of neutrophilic granulocytes. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>M-CSF can be assayed in a colony formation assay by the development of colonies containing macrophages. M-CSF is also detected in specific bioassays with cells lines that depend in their growth on the presence of M-CSF or that respond to this factor (see: BAC1.2F5; BaF3; GNFS-60; J774). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>M-CSF may be clinically relevant in its capacity to reconstitute the hematopoietic system in combination with other hematopoietic factors (see also: hematopoiesis, Hematopoietins). </p>
<p>M-CSF accelerates the recovery of the pool of leukocytes following bone marrow transplantation. In some cases of acute myeloid leukemia M-CSF induces the terminal differentiation of these cells into cell types that do no longer proliferate. </p>
<p>M-CSF may be a tumor marker for ovarian tumors and tumors of the endometrium for which it may act as an autocrine growth modulator. Since M-CSF induces the synthesis of some inflammatory proteins it may be involved in inflammatory reactions, which should then be amenable to manipulation with suitable inhibitors. </p>

<h2>CSF-3</h2>
<p>[Colony stimulating factor-3] This factor was described initially as an activity promoting the development of colonies containing granulocytes in a colony formation assay (see also: CSF for general information about colony stimulating factors). </p>
<p>The factor is isolated from cultured murine lung, human T-cell lines, human Hodgkin tumor cell lines, and human fibrous histiocytoma cell lines (Burgess et al, 1977, 1985, 1986; Byrne et al, 1986; Erickson-Miller, 1988). The factor is identical with G-CSF and the designation CSF-3 has been proposed by Pimentel (1990) following the number-based nomenclature for M-CSF (CSF-1) and GM-CSF (CSF-2). </p>

<h2>G-CSF</h2>
<p>[Granulocyte colony stimulating factor] </p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>5637-derived factor; CSF-3 (colony stimulating factor-3); CSF-beta (colony stimulating factor-beta); DF (differentiation factor); D-Factor (leukemia cell differentiation inducing factor); G-CSA (granulocytic neutrophil colony stimulating activity); GM-DF (Granulocyte/macrophage and leukemia cell differentiation inducing factor); LBGF (leukemic blast growth factor); M1 differentiation inducing activity; MGI-1G (macrophage-granulocyte inducer-1G); MGI-2 (macrophage-granulocyte inducer-2) see: MGI-2A; NAP-IF (neutrophil alkaline phosphatase inducing factor); Pluripoietin; Pluripoietin-beta; pCSF (pluripotent colony stimulating factor); SCIF (suppressor cell inducing factor); </p>
<p>WEHI-3B differentiation inducing activity; </p>
<p>see also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>A recombinant mutated form of human G-CSF is KW-2228 (= Marograstim) (see also: Recombinant cytokines). Recombinant G-CSF is also marketed under the generic name Filgrastim and Lenograstim and under the brand names Neupogen, Neutrogin, and Granocyte. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>G-CSF was isolated initially as a factor supporting the growth of colonies of granulocytes in soft agar cultures (see also: CSF and Colony formation assay). </p>
<p>The factor is secreted by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils after cell activation. It is produced also by stromal cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Epithelial carcinomas, acute myeloid leukemia cells and various tumor cell lines (bladder carcinomas, medulloblastomas), also express this factor. </p>
<p>The synthesis of G-CSF can be induced by bacterial endotoxins, TNF, IL1 and GM-CSF. Prostaglandin E2 inhibits the synthesis of G-CSF. In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of G-CSF is induced by IL17. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>G-CSF is an O-glycosylated 19.6 kDa glycoprotein with a pI of 5.5. The biologically active form is a monomer. The analysis of its cDNA has revealed a protein of 207 amino acids containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 30 amino acids. G-CSF contains 5 cysteine residues, four of which form disulfide bonds (positions 36-42; 64-74). The sugar moiety of G-CSF is not required for full biological activity. </p>
<p>Comparison of the primary sequence of G-CSF with those of the two other colony stimulating factors, GM-CSF and M-CSF, shows that the three factors are not related to each other. Murine and human G-CSF show a sequence homology of approximately 70 % at the DNA level and of 72 % at the protein level. </p>
<p>For a series of artificial cytokines derived from sequences of human IL6 and GCSF (termed Harlequin molecules) see: Muteins. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene has a length of 2.5 kb and includes five exons. The human G-CSF gene maps to chromosome 17q21-q22. It is located in the vicinity of a translocation break point which frequently occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemias. </p>
<p>The nucleotide sequences of G-CSF and IL6 reveal similarities, which suggest that both genes are evolutionary related. </p>
<p>Differential splicing of the G-CSF mRNA can lead to the production of two variant forms of this protein. One of the resulting proteins is shortened by 3 amino acids. </p>
<p>The 5'region of the G-CSF gene contains several sequence domains called CLE (conserved lymphokine element). They are binding sites for transcription factors (see also: gene expression). One binding site, designated CK-1 (see: Cytokine 1) binds a transcription factor that mediates enhanced transcription of the G-CSF gene, inducible by several other cytokines. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The G-CSF receptor (new disgnation: CD114; see also: CD antigens) is expressed on all cells of the neutrophils and granulocytes lineage. It is expressed also in placenta cells, endothelial cells and various carcinoma cell lines. </p>
<p>The human receptor has a length of 813 amino acids. It displays the classical elements of many other cytokine receptors, i.e., an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The human receptor shows 62.5 % sequence homology to the murine receptor. The receptor binds G-CSF with high affinity (Kdis = 550 picoM). The gene encoding the human G-CSF receptor (CSF-3R) maps to chromosome 1p32-p34. 3. </p>
<p>At least four different forms of the human G-CSF receptor, resulting from alternative splicing of the mRNA, have been cloned from human placenta and U937 myeloid leukemia cells. One variant contains a deletion of the transmembrane region and is probably a soluble form of the receptor. Another variant contains 27 additional amino acids in its cytoplasmic domain. This form has been described to be expressed in placenta. </p>
<p>Severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) is characterized by profound absolute neutropenia and a maturation arrest of marrow progenitor cells at the stage of promyelocytes and myelocytes (see also: hematopoiesis). It has been shown that a somatic point mutation in one allele of the G-CSF receptor gene in a patient with severe congenital neutropenia results in a cytoplasmic truncation of the receptor. The mutant receptor chain still transduces a strong growth signal but this signal is unable to trigger maturation. The mutant receptor chain probably acts in a dominant negative manner to block granulocytic maturation. </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human G-CSF is active in murine cells and vice versa. G-CSF stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells committed to the neutrophils and granulocytes lineage in a dose-dependent manner (see also: hematopoiesis). At higher concentrations this factor induces the generation of colonies in soft agar cultures (see also: Colony formation assay) containing granulocytes and macrophages. The fully differentiated neutrophilic granulocytes are functionally activated by G-CSF (see also: cell activation). G-CSF is a mitogen for some human myeloid leukemia cells and also for some carcinoma cell lines. </p>
<p>G-CSF synergises with some other cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL4. GM-CSF and G-CSF are required, for example, to develop neutrophilic colonies in vitro. The concerted action of G-CSF and Epo is required to support the growth of mixed colonies of the early erythroid progenitors. A combination of IL4 with G-CSF has been shown to lead to synergistic suppression of the growth of some human leukemic cell lines. </p>
<p>In vitro G-CSF enhances the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of granulocytes against tumor cells. G-CSF induces the synthesis of receptors for fMLP (Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) which, in turn, induces the prolonged production of oxygen radicals and the release of arachidonic acid. G-CSF also increases the synthesis of Fc-receptors for IgA. Unlike GM-CSF, G-CSF does not induce the expression of cellular markers such as CD11A and CD11C. </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>G-CSF can be assayed in Colony formation assay employing murine bone marrow cells. Stimulation of proliferation of bone marrow cells induced by G-CSF is used also to assay this factor. G-CSF is also detected in specific bioassays with cells lines that depend in their growth on the presence of G-CSF or that respond to this factor (see: AML-193; 32D; BaF3; GNFS-60; HL-60, M1; NFS-60; OCI/AML1a; WEHI-3B). </p>
<p>An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The main and most important clinical application of G-CSF is probably the treatment of transient phases of leukopenia following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. G-CSF can be used to expand the myeloid cell lineage. It has been shown that the pretreatment with recombinant human G-CSF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) prior to marrow harvest can improve the graft by increasing the total number of myeloid lineage restricted progenitor cells, resulting in stable but not accelerated myeloid engraftment of autologous marrow. </p>
<p>Animal experiments and also the administration in humans have shown that the continuous administration of G-CSF for several days increases peripheral blood counts of neutrophils by a factor of 10-15-fold without having any effects on erythrocytes and platelets. The daily administration is required to maintain elevated levels of neutrophils. The duration of chemotherapy induced neutropenia and neutropenia following autologous bone marrow transplantation is also markedly decreased by treatment with G-CSF. </p>
<p>Marked improvements of hematological parameters have been observed also in the treatment of patients with congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome), patients with neutropenia caused by diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and in cases of chronic idiopathic neutropenia. One general effect of treatment with G-CSF appears to be a marked reduction of severe infections and episodes of fever which are normally observed to occur in these patients. G-CSF treatment also allows dose intensification with various antitumor drug regimes. The dosage of antibiotics can be reduced also. </p>
<p>It appears that the subcutaneous administration of G-CSF is more favorable at low doses than intravenous injection. Some animal experiments suggest that the effects of lethal irradiation can be abolished by a timely administration of G-CSF and that the complete reconstitution of hematopoiesis is possible. At present data from human irradiated patients are not yet available. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional G-CSF gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>

Some cell types express GM-CSF constitutively. Constitutive synthesis may be the result also of promoter insertion mutations (see: IAP, intracisternal A particles). </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>GM-CSF is a monomeric protein of 127 amino acids with two glycosylation sites. The protein is synthesized as a precursor of 144 amino acids, which included a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence at the aminoterminal end. The sugar moiety is not required for the full spectrum of biological activities. Non-glycosylated and glycosylated GM-CSF show the same activities in vitro. Fully glycosylated GM-CSF is biologically more active in vivo than the non-glycosylated protein. The different molecular weight forms of GM-CSF (14 kDa, 35 kDa) described in the literature are the result of varying degrees of glycosylation. GM-CSF contains four cysteine residues (positions 54/96 and 88/121). </p>
<p>A comparison of the protein sequence of GM-CSF with those of the other colony stimulating factors reveals that they are not related to each other. Human and murine GM-CSF display 60 % homology at the protein level and 70 % at the nucleotide level. The two factors do not, however, cross-react immunologically. </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be associated with the extracellular matrix of cells as a complex with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This allows storage of the factor in a biologically inactive form. The exact mechanism by which the factor is eventually released from these depots is not known. </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be expressed also as an integral membrane protein. The membrane-bound or matrix-associated forms of the factor can interact with receptors on other nearby cells. This effectively establishes cell-to-cell contacts and may induce biological activities also in juxtaposed cells (see: juxtacrine). </p>
<p>E21R is an mutated analog of GM-CSF which selectively binds to the alpha chain of the receptor and behaves as a competitive GM-CSF antagonist. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human gene has a length of approximately 2. 5 kb and contains four exons. The distance between the GM-CSF gene and the IL3 gene is approximately 9 kb. </p>
<p>The human GM-CSF gene maps to chromosome 5q22-31 in the vicinity of other genes encoding hematopoietic growth factors (M-CSF, IL3, IL4, IL5) and the gene encoding the M-CSF receptor (see also: 5q minus syndrome). </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that deletions of the IL3 and GM-CSF locus are observed frequently in patients 5q minus syndrome. The biological significance of these deletions is, however, unclear. </p>
<p>The 5' region of the GM-CSF gene contains several sequence elements known as CLE (conserved lymphokine element). They function as binding sites for transcription factors (see also: gene expression) modulating the expression of the GM-CSF gene. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>GM-CSF receptors are expressed at densities of several 100 to several 1000 copies/cell on the cell surface of myeloid cells. The receptor is expressed also on non-hematopoietic cells such as endothelial cells and small cell lung carcinoma cells. </p>
<p>Lymphoid cells and erythroid cells do not appear to express the receptor. In receptor-positive cell lineages the receptor density decreases with increasing degrees of maturation. </p>
<p>The receptor shows significant homologies with other receptors for hematopoietic growth factors, including IL2-beta, IL3, IL6, IL7, Epo and the Prolactin receptors (see also: Cytokine receptor families). </p>
<p>One cloned subunit of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-Ralpha, 45 kDa) binds GM-CSF with low affinity. The second subunit (GM-Rbeta, 120 kDa) does not bind GM-CSF. GM-Ralpha is a protein of 400 amino acids that contains only a short cytoplasmic domain of 54 amino acids. The high affinity GM-CSF receptor is formed by the aggregation of the two receptor subunits. </p>
<p>The GM-Rbeta subunit of the receptor is also a constituent of other cytokine receptor systems. It is a component of the high affinity receptors for IL3 and IL5, both of which also contain a cytokine-specific subunit (see also: AIC2A, common beta). In the nomenclature of CD antigens this common protein has been given the designation CD131. A soluble form of the GM-CSF receptor has been described also. See also the Transgenic /Knock-out/Antisense Studies section of this entry for details on mice not expressing the common beta subunit of the receptor complex. </p>
<p>For a protein involved in signal transduction see also: CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human GM-CSF is not active on murine cells and vice versa. GM-CSF was isolated initially as a factor stimulating the growth of colonies of macrophages and granulocytes in soft agar cultures (see also: Colony formation assay). GM-CSF is indispensable for the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages. It stimulates myeloblasts and monoblasts and triggers irreversible differentiation of these cells. GM-CSF synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells. In combination with another colony stimulating factor, M-CSF, one observes the phenomenon of synergistic suppression, i.e., the combination of these two factors leads to a partial suppression of the generation of macrophage-containing cell colonies. </p>
<p>For some types of blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia GM-CSF acts as an autocrine mediator of growth. GM-CSF is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils (see also: Chemotaxis). It enhances microbicidal activity, oxidative metabolism, and phagocytotic activity of neutrophils and macrophages. It also improves the cytotoxicity of these cells. </p>
<p>GM-CSF displays a less pronounced specificity than, for example, G-CSF. It stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of precursors of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. It also functionally activates the corresponding mature forms, enhancing, for example, to the expression of certain cell surface adhesion proteins (CD11a, CD11b). The overexpression of these proteins could be one explanation for the observed local accumulation of granulocytes at sites of inflammation. In addition, GM-CSF also enhances expression of receptors for fMLP (Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) which is a stimulator of the activity of neutrophils. </p>
<p>At pico- to nanomolar concentrations GM-CSF is chemotactic for eosinophils and also influences the chemotactic behavior of these cells in response to other chemotactic factors (see also: Chemotaxis). </p>
<p>In granulocytes GM-CSF stimulates the release of arachidonic acid metabolites and the increased generation of reactive oxygen species. The activation of the Na+/H+ antiport system leads to a rapid alkalization of the cytosol. Phagocytotic activities of neutrophil granulocytes and the cytotoxicity of eosinophils is also enhanced considerably by GM-CSF. Since GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) present at sites of inflammatory responses it can be assumed that it is an important mediator for inflammatory reactions. </p>
<p>The functional state of Langerhans cells of the skin is influenced also by GM-CSF. These cells are not capable of initiating primary immune responses, for example, contact sensibilization. They are converted to highly potent immunostimulatory dendritic cells by GM-CSF (and also IL1). Langerhans cells therefore form an in situ reservoir for immunologically immature lymphoid dendritic cells. The maturation of these cells, which is seen as an increased ability to process antigens, can be downregulated by TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>At nanomolar concentrations GM-CSF induces the expression of Complement C3a receptors on basophils. Cells that normally do not respond to C3a and that have been activated by GM-CSF, degranulate in response to the C3a stimulus. This is accompanied by the release of histamine and leukotriene C4. This process may be of significance in hypersensitivity reactions associated with inflammatory responses (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells). GM-CSF has been shown also to be a potent inducer of trophoblast interferon (see: TP-1). </p>
<p>GM-CSF synergises with some other cytokines, including IL1, IL3 and G-CSF. GM-CSF and G-CSF must act in concert to allow the development in vitro of colonies containing neutrophils. </p>
<p>IL3 by itself only negligibly expands the number of circulating blood cells; a subsequent dose of GM-CSF, however, significantly increases cell numbers, probably because IL3 first leads to an expansion of those cells capable of responding to GM-CSF. </p>
<p>The observations that most cell lines that depend on exogenous IL3 (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) can also grow in the presence of GM-CSF and IL4 and that several synergistic effects are observed between GM-CSF and IL4 suggest that these three factors perform similar functions in controlling the growth of cells. There are some indications that the mechanism of signal transduction contains at least some common factors. </p>
<p>Experiments with tyrosine-specific protein kinases encoded by an oncogene have shown that the expression of this kinase activity in factor-dependent cells abolishes their dependence on GM-CSF, IL3 and IL4. The exact mechanism by which these factors regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cells is still unknown. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of GM-CSF have been studied in transgenic mice harboring a constitutively expressed GM-CSF gene. The overexpression of the transgene encoding GM-CSF leads to pathological alterations in the retina and causes blindness and also causes muscle deterioration. These mice are characterized by a very pronounced increase in activated macrophages. In addition, the overexpression of GM-CSF leads to the activation of mature macrophages secreting large amounts of IL1 and TNF, suggesting that these cytokines may be responsible for some aspects of the transgenic mouse disease. </p>
<p>Histopathological examination demonstrates a pronounced increase in the population of progenitor cells of the monocytic lineage. GM-CSF-transgenic animals usually die within months from the massive tissue damages (see also: inflammation, wound healing) resulting from the overexpression of these factors. Similar results have been obtained with mice possessing a bone marrow manipulated to overexpress GM-CSF by transformation with suitable retrovirus vectors. These findings do not seem to be of clinical significance, though. The long-term treatment of primates and mice with GM-CSF has shown that life-threatening complications do not occur. For aspects of leukemic conversion of non-leukemic cells in GM-CSF-transgenic animals see: FDCP1. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an GM-CSF gene disruption have been studied in mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Knock-out mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the GM-CSF gene are characterized by an unimpaired steady-state hematopoiesis, demonstrating that GM-CSF is not essential for maintaining normal levels of the major types of mature hematopoietic cells and their precursors in blood, marrow, and spleen (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>Most GM-CSF deficient mice are superficially healthy and fertile but develop abnormal lungs. GM-CSF deficient mice develop a progressive accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins in the alveolar space, the defining characteristics of the idiopathic human disorder pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Extensive lymphoid hyperplasia associated with lung airways and blood vessels is found also. These results demonstrate an unexpected, critical role for GM-CSF in pulmonary homeostasis. </p>
<p>Robb et al (1995) have created transgenic knock-out mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding the common beta subunit (beta C) of the GM-CSF, IL3, and IL5 receptor complexes. Homozygous deletion mutants exhibit normal development and survive to young adult life. They develop pulmonary peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis. Eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone marrow of homozygous deletion mutants are reduced, while other hematological parameters are normal. Bone marrow cells from homozygous deletion mutants do not show high-affinity binding of GM-CSF, while cells from heterozygous animals show an intermediate number of high-affinity receptors. In clonal cultures of bone marrow cells derived from homozygous deletion mutants, even high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL5 do not stimulate colony formation (see also: Colony formation assay). Differences in the systemic clearance and distribution of GM-CSF between mutant and wild-type littermates are not observed. </p>
<p>Nishinakamura et al (1996) have crossed beta-c mutant mice with mice deficient for IL3. The double-mutant mice lacking all IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 functions are apparently normal and fertile. The animals show the same reduced numbers of eosinophils and a lack of eosinophilic response to parasites as beta-c mutant mice. The immune response of the double mutant mice to Listeria mono-cytogenes is normal. Hematopoietic recovery after treatment with Fluorouracil is also normal. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanism to produce blood cells that do not depend on the presence of IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be assayed in a colony formation assay by the development of colonies containing macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and megakaryocytes (see also: Colony formation assay). GM-CSF is also detected in specific bioassays with cells lines that depend in their growth on the presence of GM-CSF or that respond to this factor (see: AML-193; B6SUt-A; BAC1.2F5; BCL1; Da; FDCP1; GF-D8; GM/SO; IC-2; MO7E; NFS-60; PT-18; TALL-103; TF-1; UT-7). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The usual dose, route and schedules for GM-CSF are 5-10 micrograms/kg/day either by 4-6 hours intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection. At such doses, adverse effects are predominantly mild-to-moderate in nature, occur in 20-30 % of patients and usually comprise fever, myalgia, malaise, rash and injection site reaction. Intravenous bolus or short infusions of GM-CSF are more likely to promote adverse effects. Some side effects are probably not due to direct actions of GM-CSF but are caused by the GM-CSF induced secretion of other cytokines such as TNF, IL1 and IL6 (see also: acute phase reaction, acute phase proteins). </p>
<p>GM-CSF can be employed for the physiological reconstitution of hematopoiesis in all diseases characterized either by an aberrant maturation of blood cells or by a reduced production of leukocytes. The main and most important clinical application of GM-CSF is probably the treatment of life-threatening neutropenia following chemo- and/or radiotherapy, which is markedly reduced under GM-CSF treatment. GM-CSF can be used also to correct chemotherapy induced cytopenias and to counteract cytopenia-related predisposition to infections and hemorrhages. </p>
<p>In order to avoid potential complications following the administration of GM-CSF careful clinical monitoring is required in certain patient groups, for example those with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, inflammatory disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia or malfunctional immunological responsiveness. </p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the use of GM-CSF enhances tolerance to cytotoxic drug treatment and can be used to prevent dose reductions necessitated by the side effects of cytotoxic drug treatment. GM-CSF treatment frequently permits to increase the doses of cytotoxic drugs per course. These studies have revealed also a significantly reduced morbidity under GM-CSF treatment. </p>
<p>There are no indications that the treatment with hematopoietic growth factors induces a depletion of the stem cell population or the expansion of non-myeloid tumor cells. It has been observed, however, that GM-CSF treatment may lead to a transient expansion of clonogenic blast cells in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. The expansion of malignant clones is reversible if GM-CSF is withdrawn. </p>
<p>One of the advantages of GM-CSF treatment may be the induction of differentiation and the activation of resting leukemic cells to enter the cell cycle where they are susceptible to cell cycle-specific drugs. </p>
<p>At present, GM-CSF represents an important advance in bone marrow transplantation and has become a standard therapy. The drug can be given safely and does not appear to increase the risk of graft-versus-host disease or tumor relapse. GM-CSF enhances the reconstitution of the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis) in patients undergoing autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplantation and patients with delayed engraftment after bone marrow transplantation. The beneficial effects of GM-CSF following autologous bone marrow transplantation consist not only of a shorter period of absolute neutropenia, but also fewer significant infections, a diminished requirement for intravenous antibiotic administration, and a shorter overall duration of inpatient hospitalization. Since GM-CSF leads to a marked expansion of the peripheral pool of stem cells this may be an alternative also to traditional methods of collecting large amounts of these cells. </p>
<p>Some animal experiments suggest that the effects of lethal irradiation can be abolished by a timely administration of GM-CSF and that the complete reconstitution of hematopoiesis is possible. At present data from human irradiated patients are not yet available. </p>
<p>Fusion proteins consisting of GM-CSF and tumor-derived tumor-specific variable regions of the immunoglobulin molecules expressed on malignant B-cells have been constructed. These chimaeric tumor idiotypic proteins are strong immunogens that induce idiotype-specific antibodies without other carrier proteins or adjuvants. They have been shown to protect recipient animals from challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of B-lymphoma tumor cells. It has been suggested that this approach may be applicable to the design of vaccines for a variety of other diseases. For other fusion proteins converting weakly immunogenic antigens into potent immunogens see: IL2 (subentry Clinical use AND Significance). </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional GM-CSF gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>Ye et al (1997) have constructed a fusion protein consisting of GM-CSF and MCAF. The recombinant human fusion protein can sustain the growth of the cell line TF-1 that depends on the continuous presence of GM-CSF (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). The recombinant protein is also chemotactic for monocytes. In vitro the fusion protein activates monocytes to inhibit the growth of several human tumor cell lines. The fusion protein is more effective in inducing cytotoxicity of monocytes than GM-CSF or MCAF alone or than a combination of GM-CSF and MCAF. The fusion protein also completely suppresses tumor formation in nude mice. </p>

<h2>CXCL1</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL1 has been identified independently as CINC-2-beta, GRO1, GRO-alpha, KC, MGSA-alpha, MIP-2, NAP-3, N51, which are CXC-Chemokines. An older designation is SCYB1 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 1]. In databanks the gene encoding rat CINC-2-beta is listed as SCYB1 and SCYB3 (see also: SCY family of cytokines). </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL1. </p>
<p>Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL1 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. </p>
<p>CXCL1 has been shown to be cleaved by the metalloproteinase MMP-12 at the ELR sequence motif, which is known to be the critical receptor binding motif (Dean et al, 2008). </p>

<h2>MGSA</h2>
<p>[melanoma growth stimulatory activity] Human MGSA (73 amino acids) is encoded by a gene mapping to chromosome 4q21. This gene is called GRO (growth regulated oncogene; see also: Oncogene) and contains four exons. The GRO gene was identified initially by its constitutive overexpression in spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster fibroblasts. </p>
<p>Three different GRO genes have been described. At the nucleotide level they show a homology of approximately 90 %. GRO-alpha encodes MGSA (also termed MGSA-alpha). Several variants are known (see also: FINAP, fibroblast-derived neutrophil-activating peptide). The human cytokine NAP-3 (neutrophil-activating protein-3) is identical with MGSA-alpha. Wuyts et al (1999) have reported that cultured tumor cells produce predominantly the full-length factor, whereas peripheral blood monocytes secreted mainly aminoterminally truncated forms. Truncated GRO-alpha [4,5,6-73] is 30-fold more active than the corresponding intact chemokine. </p>
<p>The protein encoded by GRO-beta (also termed MGSA-beta) is identical with MIP-2-alpha (see: MIP). The new designation is CXCL2 and the gene symbol is SCYB2. </p>
<p>A truncated form of GRO-beta with dramatically increased biological activities has been described under the name HSF (hematopoietic synergistic factor). Another truncated form is SB-251353. </p>
<p>GRO-gamma (also termed MGSA-gamma) is identical with MIP-2-beta (see: MIP). 53 % sequence identity is observed between GRO-alpha and a cytokine called ENA-78. The new designation for GRO-gamma is CXCL3 and the gene symbol is SCYB3. Wuyts et al (1999) have reported that cultured tumor cells produce predominantly the full-lengt factor, whereas peripheral blood monocytes secreted mainly aminoterminally truncated forms. Truncated GRO-gamma[5-73] is fivefold more active than the corresponding intact chemokine. </p>
<p>MGSA belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (CXC-Chemokines). The new designation for GRO-alpha or MGSA-alpha is CXCL1 and the gene symbol is SCYB1. A characteristic feature of the three gro factors is the presence of a conserved ELR sequence motif. Some members of the Chemokine family are encoded by genes lying in the vicinity of the GRO gene at 4q21. </p>
<p>A related protein is encoded by the murine mig gene. Its synthesis in macrophages is specifically induced by IFN-gamma. mig in turn is related to a protein called KC the synthesis of which in murine cells is induced by PDGF. Murine KC and the human GRO genes are homologous. A rat homolog of MGSA is CINC. The avian homolog of the GRO gene is 9E3. </p>
<p>The three GRO genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. GRO proteins are found predominantly in monocytes after cell activation but are expressed also in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, synovial cells, and several tumor cell lines. The expression of the GRO genes is specifically induced by IL1 in cells the proliferation of which is stimulated also by IL1. Other inducers of GRO expression are TNF and IL6. All three factors are capable of inducing the synthesis of GRO proteins approximately 100-fold under suitable conditions. </p>
<p>MGSA has inflammatory and growth-regulating properties. MGSA is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils (see also: Chemotaxis) and enhances their degranulation and the release of lysosomal enzymes. Increased concentrations of MGSA have been observed in psoriatic scales, which are also characterized by an increased infiltration of neutrophils. MGSA promotes the growth of fibroblasts. </p>
<p>MGSA is an autostimulatory growth factor for melanoma cells (see: also: autocrine for autostrimulatory growth control mechanisms). The hexapeptide antileukinate, which is a potent inhibitor of binding of alpha-Chemokines to their receptors on neutrophils, has been shown to inhibits the growth of various melanoma cell lines by preventing MGSA from binding to its receptor. MGSA produced by subsets of spinal cord astrocytes has been shown to be a strong mitogen for precursor cells of oligodendrocytes and to enhance the effect of PDGF on these cells. MGSA also is a growth factor for human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the effect can be inhibited by antileukinate (Fujisawa et al, 1999). </p>
<p>MGSA and GRO proteins are functionally related to IL8 and also bind to the same receptor albeit with different affinities. For another function of the MGSA/GRO/IL8/MIP receptor see also: CKR1. For a viral NAP-2 receptor homolog see also: ECRF-3. GRO-alpha has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>

<h2>CXCL10</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL10 has been identified independently as IP-10 [Interferon-inducible protein-10], known also as INP-10. The factor is identical with CRG-2, C7, Ifi10, mob-1. An older designation is SCYB10 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 10]. </p>
<p> Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL10 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. Cole et al (2001) have reported that CXCL10 possesses antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Proost et al (2003) have shown that CXCL10 produced by connective tissue fibroblasts attracts activated Th1 cells and natural killer cells expressing the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 to sites of infection, can also antagonize the CCR3 dependent attraction of Th2 lymphocytes, and exerts CXCR3-independent, defensin-like antibacterial activity. </p>
<p>Hensbergen et al (2004) have reported that native chemokine CXCL10 is processed in primary keratinocytes by furin to a shorter form that lacks four amino acids at the C-terminus. The truncated CXCL10 variant is a potent ligand for CXCR3 and retains its direct antibacterial activity. </p>
<p>Egesten et al (2007) have reported that CXCL10 possesses antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, a common agent causing streptococcal pharyngitis. This activity is neutralized by a bacterial virulence factor, SIC </p>
<p>Loos et al (2008) have shown that protein citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase of CXCL10 is a naturally occurring posttranslational modification. Citrullination reduces the chemoattracting and signaling capacity of CXCL10 for CXC-Chemokine receptor CXCR3 but does not affect receptor binding. The citrullinated chemokine remains active on T-cells but is weaker than authentic CXCL10. Deimination decreases heparin binding properties of CXCL10. </p>

<h2>IP-10</h2>
<p>[Interferon-inducible protein-10; IFN-inducible protein 10; immune protein-10; inflammatory protein 10; 10 kDa interferon-inducible protein] also: gamma-IP-10 or INP-10. IP-10 is called also C7. The rat homolog of this protein is called mob-1. According to a new systematic nomenclature the name CXCL10 has been proposed for this factor. The gene symbol is SCYB10. Based on the presence of a conserved three-dimensional motif and direct microbicidal activity, IP-10 has been classified as a kinocidin (microbicidal chemokine). </p>
<p>The protein has a length of 98 amino acids. It shows homology to PF4 (platelet factor-4) and belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines. IP-10 is also related to a gene called CRG-2 (see: CRG, cytokine responsive genes). Murine CRG-2 and human IP-10 are considered homologous </p>
<p>The human IP-10 genes contains four exons and maps to chromosome 4q12-21 in the vicinity of other genes encoding chemokines. </p>
<p>The receptor for IP-10 is CXCR3. IP-10 has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p>The expression of IP-10 from a variety of cells, including monocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts, is induced by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Human neutrophils produce IP-10 in response to IFN-gamma in combination with either TNF-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharides and this response is blocked by IL10 and IL4. IFN-gamma, alone or in association with agonists such as fMLP, IL8, G-CSF and GM-CSF have no effect. IFN-alpha, in combination with TNF-alpha, LPS, or IL1-beta, result in a considerable induction of IP-10 release by neutrophils (Gasperini et al, 1999). Sauty et al (1999) have shown that IFN-gamma strongly induces expression of IP-10, and the two chemokines mig and I-TAC in activated bronchial epithelium and thus may play a role in pulmonary diseases by recruiting activated T-cells. </p>
<p>The induction of the synthesis of IP-10 is used as an assay of IFN-gamma activities. </p>
<p>IP-10 has been detected in keratinocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and endothelial cells in immunologically mediated processes, such as positive tuberculin skin tests, and in growth-activated keratinocytes, such as in psoriasis. Keratinocytes in normal epidermis do not produce gamma-IP-10. In vivo murine IP-10 is synthesized predominantly in the liver and the kidney after intravenous injection of inflammatory agents, and in particular after injection of IFN-gamma, and may play an important role in the response of liver and kidney to systemic inflammation. IP-10 mRNA expression is more sensitive to suppression by IL4 when stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides than by IFN-gamma/IL2. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that IP-10 may play an important role in hypersensitivity reactions of the delayed type. Increased levels of IP-10 are found in psoriatic plaques characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils. IP-10, however, does not activate neutrophils. </p>
<p>IP-10 probably also plays a role in regulation of the growth of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis). It has been shown to suppress in vitro colony formation of highly enriched cells expressing the cell surface marker CD34 in the presence of SCF, GM-CSF, or SCF + Epo, but not in their absence with the exception of SCF. </p>
<p>Tumor cells genetically engineered to express high levels of murine IP-10 have been shown to elicit a powerful host mediated antitumor effect in vivo which appears to be mediated by the recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. IP-10 has been shown also to be a potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. </p>
<p>Marx et al (2000) have shown that treatment of endothelical cells with activators of a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), significantly inhibits induction of expression by IFN-gamma of IP-10 and the chemokines mig and I-TAC. </p>
<p>Teruya-Feldstein et al (1997) have reported higher levels of IP-10 and mig gene expression in tissues with necrosis and vascular damage from EBV positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis and nasal or nasal-type T/natural killer cell lymphomas. They also find that circulating levels of IP-10 are abnormally elevated in these patients. </p>
<p>Romagnani et al (1999) have reported that mig induces proliferation of human mesangial cells. They suggest that this chemokine may act not only as a chemoattractant for infiltrating mononuclear but also directly induce the proliferation of mesangial cells in patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis. Kanegane et al (1998) have suggested that IP-10 and also mig contribute to the antitumor effects of IL12 through their inhibitory effects on tumor vasculature. </p>

<h2>CXCL12</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL12 has been identified independently as SDF [Stromal cell-derived factor]. The protein is identical with IRH, SDF-1-alpha (CXCL12-alpha), SDF-1-beta (CXCL12-beta), PBSF, TLSF-alpha, TLSF-beta, TPAR-1. An older designation is SCYB12 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 12]. </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL12. </p>
<p>Campana et al (2009) have shown that CXCL12 in the fluid phase binds to HMG-1 secreted from dendritic cells and macrophages. This binding protects CXCL12 conformation and function in a reducing environment and thus HMG-1 may contribute to the regulation of leukocyte recruitment and motility. </p>
<p>Nie et al (2008) have reported that the ligand of CXCR4, CXCL12, produced by bone marrow stromal cells is not only the major chemoattractant for hematopoietic stem cells but also a regulatory factor that controls the quiescence of primitive hematopoietic cells. CXCL12 inhibits entry of primitive hematopoietic cells into the cell cycle, and inactivation of its receptor, CXCR4, in hematopoietic stem cells causes excessive hematopoietic stem cells proliferation. The hyperproliferative hematopoietic stem cells are able to maintain a stable stem cell compartment and sustain hematopoiesis. </p>
<p>Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL12 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. </p>

<h2>SDF</h2>
<p>[Stromal cell-derived factor] SDF-1-alpha and SDF-1-beta are small cytokines belonging to the CXC-Chemokines, and they are splice isoforms of the same gene, referred to also as CXCL12-alpha and CXCL12-beta, respectively (Tashiro et al, 1993). The factors have been referred to also as TLSF-alpha [Thymic lymphoma cell stimulating factor-alpha] and TLSF-beta [Thymic lymphoma cell stimulating factor-beta]. The protein is identical also with TPA repressed gene-1. According to a new systematic nomenclature the name CXCL12 has been proposed for this factor. The gene symbol is SCYB12. This factor is known mainly because of its chemotactic activity. For an unrelated function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immunity see: CXCL12. </p>
<p>SDF-1 is identical with a chemokine reported to function as a pre-B-cell growth factor in the presence of IL7 and isolated originally from a murine bone marrow stromal cell line (see: PBSF). It is identical also with IRH [intercrine reduced in hepatomas]. </p>
<p>SDF-1(5-67) is obtained by removal of an N-terminal tetrapeptide by cleavage with active MMP-2. Zhang et al (2003) have reported that implantation of cleaved chemokine into the basal ganglia of mice results in neuronal cell death by apoptosis and inflammation with ensuing neurobehavioral deficits. </p>
<p>The cDNAs of murine SDF-1-alpha and SDF-1-beta encode proteins of 89 and 93 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequences are identical but differ by the presence of an additional 4 amino acids at the C-terminus of SDF-1-beta. SDF-1-alpha and SDF-1-beta sequences are more than 92 % identical with those of the human counterparts. Human SDF-1-alpha and SDF-1-beta are encoded by a single gene and arise by alternative splicing. The human SDF-1 gene is located on chromosome 10q11.1 close to the ret proto-oncogene locus. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 9 residues of the factor have been shown to possess activities similar to SDF-1 although the peptides were less potent. </p>
<p>The SDF-1 gene is expressed ubiquitously with the exception of blood cells. SDF-1 acts on lymphocytes and monocytes but not neutrophils in vitro and is a highly potent chemoattractant for mononuclear cells in vivo. In addition. SDF-1 also induces intracellular actin polymerization in lymphocytes. Bleul et al (1996) have identified a lymphocyte chemotactic activity in the conditioned medium of the murine bone marrow stroma cell line MS-5. This factor is identical with SDF-1. </p>
<p>In vitro and in vivo, SDF acts as a chemoattractant (see also: Chemotaxis) for human hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing CD34 (BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU, giving rise to mixed types of progenitors, and more primitive types; see also: hematopoiesis). The chemotactic response is inhibited by pertussis toxin. Chemotaxis of CD34(+) cells in response to SDF is increased by IL3 in vitro. SDF has been shown also to induce a transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium in these cells. </p>
<p>Like some chemokines, and unlike other chemokines, that do, SDF-1 does not possess suppressive activity against immature subsets of myeloid progenitors (see also: hematopoiesis) stimulated to proliferate by multiple growth factors (Broxmeyer et al, 1999). </p>
<p>SDF-1-alpha, through interactions with its receptor CXCR4 can directly induce cell death by apoptosis in the human hNT neuronal cell line, which resembles immature post-mitotic cholinergic neurons and has a number of neuronal characteristics (Hesselgesser et al, 1998). </p>
<p>SDF-1-gamma is an SDF-1 isoform isolated from the rat. In the rat, neurons and Schwann cells are the main cellular sources of both SDF-1-beta and SDF-1-gamma mRNAs. SDF-1-beta-mRNA is the predominant isoform in embryonic and early postnatal nerve tissue. SDF-1-gamma mRNA is expressed at higher levels in adulthood. After peripheral nerve lesion a transient increase in SDF-1-beta mRNA expression is observed. Muller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including SDF-1-gamma. </p>
<p>Ma et al (1998) have studied knock-out mice lacking expression of SDF-1. These animals die perinatally, showing severely reduced development of B-cells, reduced myelopoiesis in fetal liver, and a virtual absence of myelopoiesis in bone marrow (see also: hematopoiesis). The development of T-cells is not affected. In addition, the cerebellum develops abnormally with an irregular external granule cell layer, ectopically located Purkinje cells, and numerous chromophilic cell clumps of abnormally migrated granule cells within the cerebellar anlage. Identical defects are observed in mice lacking the SDF-1 receptor, CXCR4 ligand. RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The cDNA for SDF receptor was isolated from a murine pre B-cell line, DW34. It encodes a seven transmembrane spanning domain receptor, designated Pre-B-cell derived chemokine receptor (PB-CKR). The deduced amino acid sequence shows 90 % identity with Fusin, which functions as a human coreceptor for HIV 1 (see: CXCR4). Murine SDF-1 has been shown to induce calcium influx in CHO cells transfected with Fusin. SDF-1-alpha has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3 and to vGPCR. An other receptor, RDC1 on T-cells has been identified by Balabanian et al (2005) </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an SDF gene disruption have been studied in transgenic knock-out mice carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. The animals die perinatally. The number of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFC-Mix, CFU-GM, CFU-IL7) are greatly reduced in bone marrow. </p>
<p>Myelopoiesis and B-cell lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow is eliminated. The factor is required for myelopoiesis in the bone marrow but not in the fetal liver. In addition, SDF function is not limited to the hematopoietic system. Animals lacking SDF have been shown to suffer from a ventricular septum defect. The same defect is observed also in animals deficient in endothelin-1 and in animals deficient of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha. It is not clear, however, how these factors cooperate in the formation of the ventricular septum. </p>

<h2>CXCL9</h2>

<p>CXCL9 has been identified independently as mig [monokine induced by gamma-Interferon] and is known also as CRG-10. An older designation is SCYB9 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 9]. </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL9. </p>
<p> Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL9 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Cole et al (2001) have reported that CXCL9 possesses antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Egesten et al (2007) have reported that CXCL9 possesses antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, which is neutralized by a bacterial virulence factor, SIC. Tonsil fluid from patients with streptococcal pharyngitis contains high amounts of this chemokine. In vitro, inflamed pharyngeal epithelium produce large amounts of CXCL9 in the presence of bacteria. CXCL9 is degraded by speB of Streptococcus pyogenes but, unlike other chemokines, retains its antibacterial activity and thus appears to be a major antibacterial factor in inflammed epithelium (Egesten et al, 2009). </p>
<p>The chemokine is detected also in seminal plasma of fertile donors. Significantly lower levels of CXCL9 are found in in vasectomized donors (Linge et al, 2008). CXCL9 from seminal plasma possesses antibacterial activity against the urogenital pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. </p>

<h2>mig</h2>
<p>[monokine induced by gamma-Interferon] Called also mig-1. Humig = human mig; Mumig = murine mig. </p>
<p>This factor of 14.4 kDa is isolated from murine macrophages (see also: Monokines) (Farber et al, 1990). This protein is called also M119 (name of the corresponding cDNA clone). It is identical with CRG-10 (see: CRG, cytokine responsive gene) and closely related to PF4, MGSA (Melanoma growth stimulatory activity) and IL8. According to a new systematic nomenclature the name CXCL9 has been proposed for this factor. The gene symbol is SCYB9 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 9]. The new designation for this factor is CXCL9. Based on the presence of a conserved three-dimensional motif and direct microbicidal activity, mig has been classified as a kinocidin (microbicidal chemokine). </p>
<p>Human mig has a length of 103 amino acids (11.7 kDa). The protein belongs to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines (CXC-Chemokines). The human mig gene has been localized to chromosome 4q21 in the immediate vicinity (less than 16 kb) of the gene encoding IP-10 (Lee and Farber, 1996). </p>
<p>The mig receptor is CXCR3 and this receptor is shared also by two other chemokines, I-TAC and IP-10. </p>
<p>The synthesis of mig is specifically induced in macrophages and in other cells by IFN-gamma, but not by IFN-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Human neutrophils produce mig in response to IFN-gamma in combination with either TNF-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharides and this response is blocked by IL10 and IL4. IFN-gamma, alone or in association with agonists such as fMLP, IL8, G-CSF and GM-CSF have no effect (Gasperini et al, 1999). Cultured mammary epithelial tumor cell lines express mig in response to treatment with IFN-gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Sun et al, 1999). Horton et al (1998) have observed that fragments of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan synergize with IFN-gamma in inducing the expression of mig in mouse macrophages. This effect is not observed with hyaluronan alone. </p>
<p>It is thought that mig is involved in modulating the growth, motility, and activation state of cells participating in inflammatory reactions. </p>
<p>Sauty et al (1999) have shown that IFN-gamma strongly induces expression of IP-10, and the two chemokines mig and I-TAC in activated bronchial epithelium and thus may play a role in pulmonary diseases by recruiting activated T-cells. </p>
<p>mig is a chemoattractant for stimulated but not resting T-cells. but not active on neutrophils or monocytes (Farber et al, 1997; Liao et al, 1995). </p>
<p>Marx et al (2000) have shown that treatment of endothelical cells with activators of a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), significantly inhibits induction of expression by IFN-gamma of mig and the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC. </p>
<p>mig is highly expressed in the papillae of psoriatic lesions and may play an important role as a mediator of T-cell recruitment and activation in psoriasis (Goebeler et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Sgadari et al (1997) have shown that injection of recombinant human mig into Burkitt's tumors growing subcutaneously in nude mice causes tumor necrosis associated with extensive vascular damage. Teruya-Feldstein et al (1997) have reported higher levels of mig and IP-10 gene expression in tissues with necrosis and vascular damage from EBV-positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis and nasal or nasal-type T/natural killer cell lymphomas. </p>
<p>Koga et al (1999) have demonstrated that neutralization of mig activity in mice by suitable antibodies inhibits infiltration of T-cells and macrophages into MHC class 2 disparate murine allografts and acute rejection. Allografts are also not rejected in knock-out mice lacking expression of IFN-gamma while injection of mig directly into the grafts restores T-cell infiltration and rejection. </p>
<p>Romagnani et al (1999) have reported that mig induces proliferation of human mesangial cells. They suggest that this chemokine may act not only as a chemoattractant for infiltrating mononuclear but also directly induce the proliferation of mesangial cells in patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis. </p>
<p>Kunz et al (1999) have found that strong expression of mig is associated with heavy infiltration of T-cells in human malignant melanoma and suggest that mig may be critical for the control of local melanoma tumor growth. Kanegane et al (1998) have suggested that mig and also IP-10 contribute to the antitumor effects of IL12 through their inhibitory effects on tumor vasculature. </p>
<p>Like some other chemokines, mig possesses suppressive activity against immature subsets of myeloid progenitors (see also: hematopoiesis) stimulated to proliferate by multiple growth factors (Broxmeyer et al, 1999). </p>
<p>mig has been shown to possess antiviral activity in vivo (Mahalingam et al, 1999). Liu et al (2001) have shown that the expression of mig is important in the recruitment of T-lymphocytes and host defense following viral infection of the central nervous system. </p>
<p>Muller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including mig. </p>

See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>The recommended name for bFGF is FGF-2 (see: Nomenclature Meeting Report and Recommendation, January 18, 1991, reprinted in: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Vol. 638, pages xiii-xvi). (for some personal views of problems associated with nomenclature see also: Some personal remarks). </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>bFGF is found in almost all tissues of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origin and also in tumors derived from these tissues. Endothelial cells produce large amounts of this factor. Some bFGF is associated with the extracellular matrix of the subendothelial cells. Many cells express bFGF only transiently and store it in a biologically inactive form. The mechanism by which the factor is released by the cells is not known. It is released after tissue injuries and during inflammatory processes (see also: inflammation, wound healing) and also during the proliferation of tumor cells. The expression of bFGF and related factors seems to be regulated differentially, depending on cell type and developmental age. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>bFGF is an 18 kDa protein with a length of 155 amino acids and an isoelectric point of 9.6. The factor does not contain disulfide bonds and is not glycosylated. Shorter variants with a length of 131 and 146 amino acids, respectively, have been described. The 18 kDa protein is obtained by using the classical AUG initiation codon. Some higher molecular weight forms of bFGF (22, 23, 24, 25 kDa) have been described also. They arise by translation beginning at a CUG codon. The smallest form (18 kDa) occurs predominantly in the cytosol, while the higher molecular weight forms (22, 22.5, 24 kDa) are associated with the nucleus and ribosomes. A variant isoform of bFGF associated with the endopaslmic reticulum has been designated altFGF-2. </p>
<p>bFGF is related to another member of the FGF family, aFGF and shows a homology of 55 % which is limited, however, to a few functional domains. The structure of bFGF, revealed by X-ray crystallography, shows a similar folding structure as IL1. </p>
<p>The sequences of bovine and human bFGF differ in only 2 amino acids. Human and ovine bFGF are identical. A homolog of human bFGF isolated from Xenopus laevis shows an overall sequence homology of 84 %. </p>
<p>bFGF, like aFGF, CNTF (ciliary neuronotrophic factor), and PD-ECGF (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor), does not possess a signal sequence that would allow secretion of the factor by classical secretion pathways (endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi system). Schfer et al (2004) have provided evidence showing that bFGF secretion is based on its direct translocation across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The higher molecular weight forms differ from the 18 kDa form of bFGF in their N-terminal ends. These ends contain a signal sequence known as nuclear targeting sequence which is responsible for the localization of the factor in the cell nucleus. A mechanism of growth control called intracrine has been proposed to account for some of the actions of bFGF. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The bFGF gene has a length of approximately 38 kb and contains three exons separated by three large introns. The first intron separated codons 60 and 61, the second intron codons 94 and 95. The bFGF gene codes for a total of four polypeptides, three of which using initiation from non-AUG codons. The human bFGF gene is located on chromosome 4q25. Some cells appear to express two polyadenylated different transcripts of 3.7 and 7 kb. </p>
<p>RELATED FACTORS </p>
<p>bFGF is the prototype of a large family of proteins, designated FGF family (see also: gene family). Its members display a remarkable affinity to heparin and are therefore called also HBGF (heparin binding growth factors). See also: FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-3, FGF-4, FGF-5, FGF-6, FGF-7, FGF-8, FGF-9, FGF-10, FGF-11, FGF-12, FGF-13, FGF-14, FGF-15, FGF-16, FGF-17, FGF-18, FGF-19, FGF-20, FGF-21, FGF-22, FGF-23, and HBGF-1, HBGF-2, HBGF-3, HBGF-4, HBGF-5, HBGF-6, HBGF-7, HBGF-8, HBGF-9. </p>
<p>FGF proteins have been conserved closely in evolution. Some Oncogene proteins identified in gastric, mammary, and bladder carcinomas and Kaposi sarcomas (see: int-2, hst, K-FGF) are biologically active growth factors related to bFGF. These factors and bFGF show an overall sequence homology of 30-45 %. A factor designated keratinocyte growth factor (KGF = FGF-7) and two additional factors each encoded by an oncogene, designated FGF-5 and FGF-6, are also members of the FGF family. Several related factors have been described as Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (see: FHF). </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>FGF receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of at least four receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce signals important in a variety of developmental and physiological processes related to cell growth and differentiation. bFGF and also aFGF glycoprotein membrane receptors of 125-130 kDa and 145-165 kDa are expressed on the cell surfaces of various FGF-sensitive cells at densities of 2x10**5x10**5/cell. The intracellular domains of these receptors encode a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. Binding of the ligand to the receptor leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor protein. </p>
<p>The various receptors for FGF and isoforms arising by alternative splicing are expressed often in a tissue-specific manner. However, a single cell can express more than one isoform. Different specificities are observed with different isoforms. In addition, signaling by these receptors may differ. Cells therefore can display a wide range of responses, depending, among other things, on the relative amounts of different receptor isoforms expressed. </p>
<p>The genes encoding bFGF receptors are members of a gene family, and homologous proteins binding either bFGF, aFGF, or related factors have been isolated also from other species. There is roughly 50-70 % homology between human FGF receptors. The gene known as flg (fms-like gene) encodes a 145 kDa receptor protein. This gene is considered to be a homolog of the corresponding chicken gene (Cek1). The official new nomenclature for flg is FGFR1. </p>
<p>This gene is also related to another gene isolated from humans, mice, and chicken (Cek3), designated bek (125 kDa), a human gene called TK-14, and a gene encoding the receptor for KGF (keratinocyte growth factor). The official nomenclature for this type of bFGF receptor which binds aFGF equally well is FGFR2, and alternative splicing of the FGFR2 gene has been demonstrated to yield the splice variants bek and K-sam. </p>
<p>Yet another type of bFGF receptor, designated FGFR3 (Cek2), also binds aFGF and bFGF equally well. This receptor exists as a membrane-bound form of 125 kDa. </p>
<p>A fourth receptor, mapping at 5q33-qter (see also: 5q minus syndrome) and designated FGFR4 (flg-2), binds aFGF with highest affinity, followed by K-FGF/hst-1 and bFGF. </p>
<p>Differential splicing in the extracellular region of FGFR1 has been shown to generate receptor variants with different ligand-binding specificities. One variant binds bFGF with a 50-fold lower affinity. Truncated forms of FGFR1 have been found as Fibroblast growth factor binding proteins in human and calf plasma. </p>
<p>Binding of bFGF to one of its receptors requires the interaction with heparan sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix before full functional activity is obtained (see also: coreceptor). Syndecan-1 and glypican-1 are known low-affinity receptors for bFGF that present the growth factors to the high-affinity receptor. The involvement of proteoglycans is demonstrated also by the ability of heparinase to inhibit receptor binding and biological activity of bFGF. It has been observed that the membrane-associated factor is phosphorylated by a protein kinase also located on the cell surface, which may additionally alter its activity and bioavailability. Heparin has been shown to protect bFGF from inactivation by proteases, acids, and heat. It also improves its capacity to bind to the receptors and hence potentiates the biological activities of bFGF. This feature may be of physiological importance because mast cells, for example, contain a lot of heparin which could be released during degranulation. In addition, heparin also increases the biological half life of bFGF. </p>
<p>Binding of bFGF (and also of aFGF) to receptor proteins can be inhibited by Suramin, and also by protamine. At least one receptor type has been described to be utilized as a receptor for Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The wide spectrum of biological activities is revealed by the plethora of different names. A multifunctional role of bFGF is suggested by the many different receptor phenotypes expressed in various cell types. bFGF stimulates the growth of fibroblasts, myoblasts, osteoblasts, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, chondrocytes, and many other cell types. In capillary endothelial cells bFGF acts in an autocrine manner. The mitogenic action of bFGF for endothelial cells can be potentiated by thrombin. Transferrin and HDL (high density lipoprotein) also support the activity of bFGF on endothelial cells. </p>
<p>bFGF promotes the maturation and maintenance of cholinergic neurons and acts as a mitogen for chromaffin cells. It also influences the proliferation, differentiation, and function of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. For some cell lines, for example PC12, bFGF is a neurite outgrowth-promoting factor with an activity that is on the same order of magnitude as NGF. For some cholinergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neuronal cells bFGF acts as a differentiation factor promoting outgrowth of neurites and promoting survival. In some cell types this activity is as pronounced as that of CNTF (ciliary neuronotrophic factor). In some cells bFGF appears to induce the expression of certain neuronal-specific genes (for example, SCG-10) the synthesis of which is induced also by NGF. </p>
<p>Rat hippocampal and human cortical neurons have been shown to be protected by bFGF against induced damage induced by iron, which is believed to contribute to the process of cell damage and death resulting from ischemic and traumatic insults (see also: inflammation, wound healing) by catalyzing the oxidation of protein and lipids. bFGF has been shown to allow long-term culture of rat primary hippocampal neurons in serum-free culture media, yielding continuous untransformed cell lines that can be passaged. </p>
<p>Immortalized rat fibroblasts, genetically altered to secrete bFGF into the conditioned medium, have been shown to decrease excitotoxic lesion size by 30 % after implantation in rat brain near the striatum 7 days before striatal infusion of excitotoxic quantities of an NMDA-receptor agonist. </p>
<p>bFGF has been shown to be a promoting or inhibitory modulator of cellular differentiation also for other cell types. bFGF is not only a mitogen for chondrocytes but also inhibits their terminal differentiation. In early embryos bFGF functions as a differentiation factor that induces tissues destined to produce ectodermal structures to differentiate into mesodermal tissues. In cultures of rat retina cells bFGF induces photoreceptor differentiation. The influence of bFGF on differentiation processes are probably the result of a complex interaction with other factors. Elevated levels of bFGF are observed during early embryonic development and it has been suggested that bFGF, in combination with other factors showing similar activities, for example, TGF-beta, may be involved in the development of the mesoderm. </p>
<p>There are many instances in which bFGF retards senescence of cells, thus allowing maintenance of cells in vitro which would normally lose their differentiated phenotype in long-term cultures. </p>
<p>In the pituitary bFGF regulates the secretion of Thyrotropin and Prolactin. bFGF also acts as an ovarian hormone and differentially regulates the expression of steroids. bFGF modulates the proliferation and differentiation of granulosa cells and inhibits induction of receptors for Luteinizing hormone mediated by FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). bFGF also blocks the synthesis of enzymes the expression of which is induced by FSH. bFGF stimulates the synthesis of progesterone. Some of these effects of bFGF are, in turn, blocked by TGF-beta, suggesting that the ratio of bFGF/TGF-beta is used for fine control of these processes. </p>
<p>bFGF also has direct central actions and inhibits food intake in rats after intracerebroventricular injection for at least 12 hours. bFGF has been implicated as an embryonic mesoderm inducing factor and there is also some evidence for an organ- and sex-specific role of FGF in the development of the fetal mammalian reproductive tract. </p>
<p>bFGF (and aFGF) are involved also in angiogenesis by controlling the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells. The expression of plasminogen activator and collagenase activity by these cells is enhanced by bFGF. bFGF is probably one of the factors responsible early in development for the growth of new capillary blood vessels colonizing the mesencephalon and telencephalon which at this time are essentially free of blood vessels. bFGF and/or closely related factors may be engaged also in tumor angiogenesis, facilitating the invasive growth and metastasis of tumors by inducing the synthesis of proteases. Tumors expressing an oncogene encoding factors resembling bFGF constitutively have been shown to support unlimited angiogenesis. </p>
<p>bFGF also plays an important physiological role in tissue regeneration and wound healing. </p>
<p>If bFGF that lacks a normal secretory signal sequence is furnished with a hydrophobic signal sequence the introduction of this recombinant genes into cells leads to malignant transformation and yields cells that are tumorigenic in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies directed against bFGF inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Treatment of these cells with low and nontoxic concentrations (0.5-2.5 microgram/mL) of negatively charged, nonsulfated aromatic compounds (for example, aurin tricarboxylic acid, 4-hydroxyphenoxyacetic acid) result in restoration of their normal proliferative rate, morphological appearance, and adhesion properties. </p>
<p>The synthesis of bFGF by vascular smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts is induced by IL1. In human endothelial cells bFGF reduces the expression of cyclo-oxygenase. The same inhibitory action on bFGF activities is shown also by IFN-gamma which is itself induced by different forms of FGF. In endothelial cells bFGF reduces the expression of the receptor for TGF-beta (see also: Receptor transmodulation), thus effectively modulating the inhibitory action of TGF-beta on endothelial cells. The activity of bFGF (and also of aFGF) on the vascular epithelium is inhibited strongly by TGF-beta. TGF-beta may, however, also have positive actions on bFGF mediated processes in other cell types. </p>
<p>The release of bFGF by astrocytes is enhanced significantly by IL1, IL6 or EGF. Other Lymphokines, and also NGF, have no effect. In microglial cells the release of bFGF is considerably reduced by IL3, EGF and NGF. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>A dominant-negative FGF receptor mutant has been used to block FGF function in suprabasal keratinocytes of transgenic mice. Expression of the mutant receptor, which blocks signal transduction in cells when co-expressed with wild-type receptors, disrupts the organization of epidermal keratinocytes and induces epidermal hyperthickening, showing that FGF is essential for the morphogenesis of suprabasal keratinocytes and for the establishment of the normal differentiation program of keratinocytes. </p>
<p>Treatment of various human tumor cell lines (melanomas, glioblastomas) with antisense RNA directed against bFGF has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of these cells and their ability to form colonies in soft agar (see also: Colony formation assay). </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>bFGF activities can be assayed in a proliferation assay using CCL-39 hamster fibroblasts, human SW-13 cells, 3T3 cells, CRL 1395 cells, bovine FBHE cells, or SR-4987 cells. bFGF can be assayed by a sensitive enzyme immunoassay. bFGF can be detected also by a modification of the Cell blot assay. An alternative and entirely different method of detecting bFGF is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. Golden et al (2000) have described a DNA aptamer directed against human bFGF that is used in the sensitive detection of this growth factor. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>Some preclinical studies have been performed with recombinant bFGF (see also: Recombinant cytokines). It is assumed that bFGF will be of potential interest as a factor promoting wound healing and revascularization of tissues. Animals experiments with bFGF have shown that it promotes endosteal, but not periosteal, bone formation and bFGF may thus be a potential agent for treatment osteoporosis, which may increase bone mass without causing outward deformation of the skeletal bones. </p>
<p>Another possible use of bFGF is suggested by its neurotrophic activities (see also: Neurotrophins). bFGF and also related factors may be useful to support regeneration of tissues after brain, spinal chord, and peripheral nerve injuries (see also: inflammation, wound healing). Animal experiments have shown that the infusion of bFGF positively influences the growth of retinal ganglion cells and also nerve regeneration. Injections of bFGF maintain photoreceptors that would normally degenerate, for example, in cases of inherited retinal dystrophy. bFGF and related factors may play a role also in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. </p>
<p>bFGF is produced in most gliomas and is involved in tumorigenesis and malignant progression, functioning in an autocrine manner. It may play an important role also in tumor neovascularization as a mediator acting in a paracrine manner. Overexpression of bFGF and aFGF in pancreatic cancers has been found to be associated with a more advanced tumor stage. bFGF has been found also to be overexpressed in gastric and renal cell carcinomas. Very high levels of bFGF have been found in the serum and/or urine of patients with many types of cancer. bFGF has been implicated also in the pathology of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas. </p>
<p>Since the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells play a pivotal role in various vascular diseases and since bFGF plays a significant role by acting on endothelial cells in an autocrine manner specific ways to block its expression may have considerable therapeutic implications. By employing antisense RNA specifically blocking the expression of bFGF it has been possible to suppress proliferation of endothelial cells. </p>
<p>bFGF has been shown to improve cardiac systolic function, to reduce infarct size, and to increase the number of arterioles and capillaries in the infarct. Thus, the angiogenic action of bFGF might lead to a reduction in infarct size in a canine experimental myocardial infarct model. </p>
<p>The observation that HSV-1 uses one of the bFGF receptors as an entry port suggests that it may be possible to use specific receptor antagonists to block virus entry, thus preventing later complications of the infection. For further uses of bFGF exploiting the specific interaction of bFGF with its receptor see also: Mitotoxins, Saporin. </p>
<p>Abnormal receptor functions caused by mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 have been found to be responsible for a variety of clinical syndromes associated with craniosynostosis. </p>

<h2>HGF</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>

<p> Copyright © 2012 by H IBELGAUFTS. All rights reserved. ENTRY COMPLETED. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) hepatocyte growth factor </p>
<p>This factor is isolated from bovine liver (Ueono et al, 1986). It is mitogenic for hepatocytes. This factor is identical with bFGF and is not identical with HGF = scatter factor (entry -3-). </p>
<p> Copyright © 2012 by H IBELGAUFTS. All rights reserved. ENTRY COMPLETED. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-3-) hepatocyte growth factor </p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>F-TCF (fibroblast tumor cytotoxic factor); HL-60-HGF; HPTA (Hepatopoietin A); SF (scatter factor); TCF (tumor cytotoxic factor). The factor is referred to now frequently as HGF/SF (for Hepatocyte growth factor-scatter factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>HGF was isolated initially from the serum of partially hepatectomised rats. It is produced predominantly in the liver and the pancreas. The liver cells mainly responsible for the synthesis of HGF are Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells. </p>
<p>The synthesis of HGF is stimulated in particular by injuries affecting liver tissues (hepatitis, ischemia, hepatectomy) (see also: inflammation, wound healing). In liver cells the expression of the HGF gene can be repressed strongly by TGF-beta. In human skin fibroblasts the synthesis of HGF is induced by both molecular forms of IL1. </p>
<p>HGF can be isolated also from platelets, kidney, and human serum. HGF is expressed also in human placenta and is found predominantly in trophoblastic tumors. HGF is synthesized also by the HL-60 cell line. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>HGF consists of two subunits held by a disulfide bond. The alpha subunit (69 kDa) has a length of 440 amino acids. The beta subunit (34 kDa) has a length of 234 amino acids. The beta chain of the factor shows approximately 38 % homology at the protein level to the serine protease domain of plasminogen. A variant of the beta chain has been shown to function as a subunit of a hybrid cytokine known as PPBSF [pre-pro-B-cell growth stimulating factor]. </p>
<p>HGF is a glycoprotein; the non-glycosylated factor is also bioactive. The beta-chain of the murine and rat factor display approximately 95 % sequence identity. The murine beta-chain also shows approximately 70 % sequence identity with rabbit HPTA (hepatopoietin A). </p>
<p>Miau et al (1996) have reported the identification and characterization of a novel variant HGF lacking the beta chain from the conditioned medium of stromal cells derived from mouse spleen. Compared to human HGF, it has much lower heparin binding activity. </p>
<p>Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is a variant of HGF that is mitogenic for epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and melanocytes. </p>
<p>A variant of HGF is obtained by alternative splicing. This variant, designated HGF/NK2, is no longer mitogenic and inhibits the HGF induced proliferation of cells. This demonstrates that one and the same gene encodes a growth factor and a natural specific antagonist. The HGF/NK1 isoform, which is shorter than HGF/NK2, possesses modest mitogenic and scattering activity. It possesses partial agonist/antagonist properties. For another truncated form that acts as a specific inhibitor of HGF actions see: HGF/NK4. </p>
<p>dHGF is a naturally occurring splice variant of HGF that lacks a sequence of 5 amino acids in the first kringle domain. The deletion significantly alters the biological activities, solubility, and immunological property of HGF. HGF is more potent than dHGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human aorta smooth muscle cells, and the murine myeloblastic cell line NSF-60. dHGF is more potent than HGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in LLC-PK1 (pig kidney epithelial cells), OK (American opossum kidney epithelial cells), and rat hepatocytes (Shima et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Bell et al (1999) have generated transgenic mice expressing dHGF in the liver under control of the albumin promoter. These mice develop normally, have an enhanced rate of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, and exhibit a threefold higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma beyond 17 months of age. Overexpression of dHGF dramatically accelerates diethyl-nitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis. These tumors arise faster, are significantly larger, more numerous and more invasive than those appearing in non-transgenic littermates. Liver tumors and cultured tumor cell lines from dHGF transgenics express high levels of HGF and its receptor c-met. </p>
<p>Both subunits of HGF are obtained by endoproteolytic cleavage of a common preproprotein of 728 amino acids (approximately 90 kDa) which itself is biologically inactive. The inactive precursor is mostly found in a matrix-associated form. Maturation of the precursor into the active heterodimer takes place in the extracellular environment and results from proteolytic cleavage by urokinase which thus acts as a HGF convertase. </p>
<p>The inactive single-chain precursor of HGF secreted by the producing cells is converted to a biologically active heterodimer by a serine protease, the activity of which is induced in injured liver tissue. A serum serine protease that activates single-chain HGF has been identified (see: HGFA). </p>
<p>An inhibitor of HGF activator (Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1; abbr. HAI-1) has been isolated by Shimomura et al (1997) from the conditioned medium of the human MKN45 stomach carcinoma cell line. The sequence of the cDNA suggests that the inhibitor is a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. A second inhibitor (Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2; abbr. HAI-2) has been isolated from the same cell line by Kawaguchi et al (1997). HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and 2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. Both inhibitors are produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The HGF gene has a length of approximately 70 kb and contains 18 exons. It encodes an mRNA of 6.3 kb. The human gene maps to chromosome 7q11.2-21.1. An IL6 responsive element (see also: gene expression) and a binding site for an IL6-specific transcription factor, C/EBP-beta (see also: IL6) lies in close proximity to the transcription initiation site of the HGF gene. </p>
<p>The murine HGF gene contains a variety of different putative regulatory elements, including four copies of the IL6 responsive element (IL6RE), two potential binding sites for C/EBP-beta, a TGF-beta-1 inhibitory element (TIE element), a cAMP response element (CRE), two estrogen response elements (ERE), a potential vitamin D response element (VDRE) overlapping with a chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) transcription factor binding element, two liver-specific transcription factor (C/EBP) binding sites, and a B-cell and macrophage-specific transcriptional factor binding site (PU.1/ETS). </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The HGF receptor is encoded by the met proto-oncogene on human chromosome 7p11-4. This gene encodes a protein with intrinsic tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in its intracellular domain. The heavy chain is thought to play an important role in the interaction of HGF with its receptor and the light chain is further required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. </p>
<p>The phosphorylated receptor binds phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase which is responsible for post receptor signaling. </p>
<p>Alternative splicing leads to the formation of various isoforms of the receptor. It has been suggested that these isoforms are biologically active and may mediate different biologically responses. The existence of further non-met receptors for HGF has been suggested also. </p>
<p>Ohnishi et al (2012) have reported that the beta chain of HGF utilizes CD206 expressed on Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells as a receptor. Binding of HGF beta chain, to CD206 enhances the ingestion of latex beads, or of apoptotic neutrophils, suggesting that this complex may provide a new pathway for the enhancement of cell clearance systems, which is associated with resolution of inflammation.  </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of HGF are not species-specific. </p>
<p>HGF is a hepatotrophic factor that stimulates the proliferation of hepatocytes in vivo. HGF is the most potent known mitogen for hepatocytes in primary culture. It is one of the major mitogens engaged in liver regeneration processes following partial hepatectomy and other liver injuries (see also: inflammation, wound healing). HGF has been shown also to be involved in the regeneration of kidney tubules. It is a mitogen for kidney epithelial cells. In vitro HGF induces endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate (see also: Scatter factor). </p>
<p>HGF and EGF activities are additive. The mitogenic effect of HGF is enhanced by norepinephine. The biological activity of HGF can be inhibited by suramin. HGF abolishes the inhibitory actions of TGF-beta on cellular proliferation. HGF has been shown also to be one of the priming factors for neutrophils (see also: cell activation). </p>
<p>At present HGF is the only known factor influencing the three-dimensional growth of cells in three-dimensional collagen gels where it leads to the formation of tubular structures in growing epithelial cells. HGF is therefore a multifunctional cytokine that acts as a mitogen, a motogen (see: Scatter factor) and a morphogen, explaining its functions in organogenesis and tissue regeneration. </p>
<p>HGF also shows paracrine activities in that it is produced by kidney mesangial cells and acts on renal epithelial cells. HGF also stimulates the growth of human melanoma cells and murine keratinocytes. The growth of some hepatocellular carcinomas and some human tumor cell lines (B6/F1 melanoma, KB-cells) is inhibited by HGF. </p>
<p>In the rabbit cornea, highly purified HGF promotes neovascularization at subnanomolar concentrations. </p>
<p>HGF synergizes with IL3 and GM-CSF to stimulate colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro and may, therefore, also modulate hematopoiesis. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of HGF have been studied in transgenic mice expressing the factor under the control of albumin regulatory sequences. Hepatocytes of HGF-transgenic mice express increased levels of HGF as an autocrine growth modulator. The experiments also show that HGF increases growth and repair processes when expressed for long periods in the liver: the livers of HGF-transgenic mice recover completely in half the time needed for their normal siblings after partial hepatectomy. Levels of cellular myc and jun mRNA were increased in HGF-transgenic mice. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>A sensitive ELISA assay is available. Other assay systems are based on the activity of HGF as SF (scatter factor). Proliferation of CCL-64 cells induced by HGF has been used also as an assay. The induction of IL11 by HGF in SaOS-2 cells has been used as a bioassay for HGF. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>

<p>This factor may be of clinical importance due to its involvement in tissue regeneration following hepatectomy. </p>

<h2>IFN-alpha</h2>
<p>interferon-alpha, abbr. also aIFN. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>B-cell interferon; Buffy coat interferon; Foreign cell induced interferon; Leukocyte interferon (LeIFN); Lymphoblast interferon (LyIFN-alpha); Lymphoblastoid interferon (LyIFN-alpha); abbr. frequently HLBI [human lymphoblastoid interferon] Namalwa interferon; see also: Namalwa cell line pH2-stable interferon; Type 1 interferon; RSV induced factor. Some of the activity ascribed to EP (endogenous pyrogens) can be attributed also to IFN-alpha. See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>Preparations of leukocyte interferon and lymphoblastoid interferon are mixtures of relatively undefined composition of various IFN-alpha subtypes. LeIFN-alpha may contain further factors that influence the proliferation and differentiation of cells (see also: Cytokines) while LyIFN-alpha may contain variable amounts of IFN-beta. For a synthetic IFN-alpha see also: Consensus interferon. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IFN-alpha forms are produced by monocytes/macrophages, lymphoblastoid cells, fibroblasts, and a number of different cell types following induction by viruses, nucleic acids, glucocorticoid hormones, and low-molecular weight substances (n-butyrate, 5-bromodeoxy uridine). </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>At least 23 different variants of IFN-alpha are known. The individual proteins have molecular masses between 19-26 kDa and consist of proteins with lengths of 156-166 and 172 amino acids. </p>
<p>All IFN-alpha subtypes possess a common conserved sequence region between amino acid positions 115-151 while the amino-terminal ends are variable. Many IFN-alpha subtypes differ in their sequences at only one or two positions. Naturally occurring variants also include proteins truncated by 10 amino acids at the carboxy-terminal end. </p>
<p>Disulfide bonds are formed between cysteines at positions 1/98 and 29/138. The disulfide bond 29/138 is essential for biological activity while the 1/98 bond can be reduces without affecting biological activity. All IFN-alpha forms contain a potential glycosylation site but most subtypes are not glycosylated. In contrast to IFN-gamma IFN-alpha proteins are stable at pH2. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>There are at least 23 different IFN-alpha genes. They have a length of 1-2 kb and are clustered on human chromosome 9p22. It is not known whether all these genes are expressed following stimulation of the cells. In some cell systems expression of some subtypes (IFN-alpha-1, IFN-alpha-2, IFN-alpha-4) is stronger than those of others. IFN-alpha genes do not contain intron sequences found in many other eukaryotic genes (see also: gene expression). </p>
<p>Based upon the structures two types of IFN-alpha genes, designated class 1 and II, are distinguished. They encode proteins of 156-166 and 172 amino acids, respectively. </p>
<p>Deletions covering 9p22 are observed frequently in cells of lymphoblastoid leukemias. It is not known to date whether this is of significance with respect to interferon expression. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>For further information see: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The gene encoding the IFN-alpha receptor maps to human chromosome 21q22.1. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta are thought to bind to the same IFN binding subunit which is expressed in 100-5000 copies in IFN-alpha sensitive and -resistant cells and is associated with other proteins. The interferon IFN-omega and also some other Type 1 interferons bind to the IFN-alpha/IFN-beta receptor. Another receptor expressed on B-lymphocytes is identical with CD21. This receptor also binds Epstein-Barr virus through its gp350/220 coat protein. </p>
<p>Signal transduction mechanisms elicited after binding of IFN-alpha to its receptors involves tyrosine phosphorylation (see also: PTK; protein tyrosine kinase) of various non-receptor tyrosine kinases belonging to the Janus kinases. </p>
<p>Soluble forms of the IFN-alpha receptor, corresponding to truncated forms of the extracellular domain of the cell surface IFN-alpha receptor, have been found in human serum and in normal human urine. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>All known subtypes of IFN-alpha show the same antiviral antiparasitic, antiproliferative activities in suitable bioassays although they may differ in relative activities. </p>
<p>Human IFN-alpha is also a potent antiviral substance in murine, porcine, and bovine cell systems. Human IFN-alpha is less active in rodent cells. Site-directed mutagenesis techniques have been used to create some variants of certain subtypes (IFN-alpha-2) that display approximately 100-fold enhanced antiviral activities in mouse cells. </p>
<p>IFN-alpha inhibits the expression of a number of cytokines in hematopoietic progenitor cells (see: hematopoiesis) that in turn induce a state of competence in these cells allowing them to pass from the G0 into the S phase of the cell cycle. </p>
<p>The growth of some tumor cell types in vitro is inhibited by IFN-alpha which may stimulate also the synthesis of tumor-associated cell surface antigens. In renal carcinomas IFN-alpha reduces the expression of receptors for EGF. IFN-alpha also inhibits the growth of fibroblasts and monocytes in vitro. IFN-alpha also inhibits the proliferation of B-cell in vitro and blocks the synthesis of antibodies. IFN-alpha also selectively blocks the expression of some mitochondrial genes. </p>
<p>IFN-alpha specifically induces the expression of a number of genes (see also: Mx). These genes contain regulatory DNA sequences within their promoter regions (ISRE; Interferon-stimulated response element; see: IRS, interferon response sequence) that function as binding sites for a number of transcription factors. Some of these genes are expressed also in response to other interferons (see: IFN). </p>
<p>The occurrence of spontaneous antibodies directed against IFN-alpha has been observed in patients with certain types of autoimmune diseases, generalized virus infections, and a number of tumors. Some inbred strains of mice appear to produce constitutively antibodies directed against IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Interferon expression in the testes of transgenic mice has been shown to cause sterility. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IFN-alpha is assayed by a cytopathic effect reduction test employing human and bovine cell lines (see: MDBK, WISH). Minute amounts of IFN-alpha can be assayed also by detection of the Mx protein specifically induced by this interferon. A sandwich ELISA employing bispecific monoclonal antibodies for rapid detection (10 units/mL = 0.1 ng/mL within 2-3 hours) is available. Lewis describes a bioassay based on induction of a reporter gene linked to a promoter element that responds to interferons (see: IFN). Production of the reporter gene product is dose-dependent in the range of 1 to approximately 100 U/mL of IFN and sensitivity is comparable to standard cytopathic effect assays. </p>
<p>The MxR assay (see: Mx) involves use of a genetically engineered Vero cell line to measure IFN-alpha. </p>
<p>Mire-Sluis et al (1996) have described bioassays for IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-omega that exploit the ability of these factors to inhibit proliferation of TF-1 cells induced by GM-CSF. The bioassays can be used also with Epo and TF-1 cells, or Epo and Epo-transfected UT-7 cells. </p>
<p>For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IFN-alpha is mainly employed as a standard therapy for hairy cell leukemia, metastasizing renal carcinoma and AIDS-associated angiogenic tumors of mixed cellularity known as Kaposi sarcomas. It is also active against a number of other tumors and viral infections. IFN-alpha is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of condyloma acuminata (genital or venereal warts). </p>
<p>Hairy cell leukemia constitutes approximately 2 % of all leukemias. Treatment with IFN-alpha markedly improves blood and bone marrow parameters. The number of necessary blood transfusions is reduced and the frequency of life-threatening infections is also reduced. </p>
<p>Treatment of disseminated Kaposi sarcomas results in complete or partial remissions in approximately 30-40 % of the patients. In patients with advanced malignant melanomas treatment with a combination of IFN-alpha and chemotherapy (Dacarbazin, DTIC) has been found to be particularly effective and to be superior to treatment with IFN-alpha alone. Complete remissions and also a significant increase in survival times have been observed in responders. Intralesional therapy with IFN-alpha has been found to cause almost complete disappearance of tumors in 80 % of patients with basaliomas. </p>
<p>Moderate and high doses of IFN-alpha are one of the most effective forms of treatment of metastasizing renal carcinomas. Response rates of combinations of vinblastin and IFN-alpha are approximately 25 % higher than those with interferon alone. Response rates have been reported to be improved by combining IFN-alpha with antineoplastic agents or other cytokines. Combination therapy with systemically administered IL2 and IFN-alpha has resulted in long-term remissions in 30 % of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. </p>
<p>Treatment of CML with IFN-alpha causes hematological remissions in most patients and has been shown to cause a complete elimination of the PH1-(Philadelphia chromosome)-positive cells in the bone marrow of some patients. </p>
<p>Prospective studies are now under way to evaluate the effectiveness of IFN-alpha in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (Mycosis fungoides, Szary syndrome), multiple myelomas, condylomata acuminata and chronic active hepatitis B. </p>
<p>Some patients treated with genetically engineered recombinant IFN-alpha-2 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) have been shown to develop neutralizing antibodies against interferon. Increasing levels of antibodies correlate with increasing reoccurrence of the disease. Therefore, patients should be monitored for the presence and clinical relevance of IFN-alpha antibodies to determine those who could respond to alternative treatment. It has been assumed that the recombinant protein (see also: Recombinant cytokines) may possess an altered tertiary structure leading to the exposure of a novel immunoreactive epitope not normally recognized in natural IFN-alpha. Continuation of the treatment with natural purified IFN-alpha leads to the disappearance of antibodies and also causes remissions. </p>
<p>In many instances a combination of the various interferons (see: IFN) has been found to cause synergistic effects. The antiviral/antiproliferative/antitumor properties of IFN-alpha is potentiated by febrile temperatures. </p>
<p></p>

<h2>IFN-gamma</h2>
<p>Gamma-Interferon, abbr. gIFN. Approved gene symbol IFNG. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>Antigen induced interferon; Immune interferon (IIF); Type 2 interferon; T interferon; Mitogen induced interferon; pH2-labile interferon. Many of the activities described in the older publications as MAF (macrophage activating factor) or TRF (T-cell replacing factor) are due to IFN-gamma. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IFN-gamma is produced mainly by T-cells and natural killer cells activated by antigens, mitogens, or alloantigens. It is produced by lymphocytes expressing the surface antigens CD4 and CD8. The synthesis of IFN-gamma is induced, among other things, by IL2, bFGF, and EGF. The synthesis of IFN-gamma is inhibited by 1-alpha,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3, dexamethasone and CsA (Cyclosporin A). </p>
<p>B-cells also produce IFN-gamma, and constitutive synthesis has been observed in many established human B-cell lines. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IFN-gamma is a dimeric protein with subunits of 146 amino acids. The protein is glycosylated at two sites. The pI is 8.3-8.5. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma is synthesized as a precursor protein of 166 amino acids including a secretory signal sequence of 23 amino acids. Two molecular forms of the biologically active protein of 20 and 25 kDa have been described. Both of them are glycosylated at position 25. The 25 kDa form is also glycosylated at position 97. The observed differences of natural IFN-gamma with respect to molecular mass and charge are due to variable glycosylation patterns. 40-60 kDa forms observed under non-denaturing conditions are dimers and tetramers of IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Recombinant IFN-gamma isolated from Escherichia coli is also biologically active and glycosylation therefore is not required for biological activity (see also: Recombinant cytokines). IFN-gamma contains two cysteine residues that are not involved in disulfide bonding. </p>
<p>At least six different variants of naturally occurring IFN-gamma have been described. They differ from each other by variable lengths of the carboxyterminal ends. The biological activities of these variants do not differ from recombinant IFN-gamma obtained from Escherichia coli. It has been proposed that at least some of these variants are the result of proteolytic cleavage by exopeptidases and hence constitute purification artifacts. In contrast to IFN-alpha and IFN-beta IFN-gamma is labile at pH 2. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma can exist in a form associated with the extracellular matrix and may, therefore, exert juxtacrine growth control. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma does not display significant homology with the other two interferons, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. Murine and human IFN-gamma show approximately 40 % sequence homology at the protein level. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human gene has a length of approximately 6 kb. It contains four exons and maps to chromosome 12q24.1. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>A number of binding proteins with molecular masses between 70 and 160 kDa have been described for IFN-gamma. They are expressed on all types of human cells with the exception of mature erythrocytes. The receptor expressed in monocytes and other hematopoietic cells (see also: hematopoiesis) has a molecular mass of 140 kDa. A 54 kDa protein is observed in other cell types. The expression of the IFN-gamma receptor on human peripheral blood monocytes is significantly increased by GM-CSF. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma receptors are N- and O-glycosylated and bind IFN-gamma with an affinity of 10**-10 - 10**-11 M. The extracellular domain of the human 54 kDa receptor has a length of 229 amino acids and a transmembrane domain of 20 amino acids. The intracellular domain has a length of 222 amino acids and is involved probably in signal transduction. </p>
<p>The gene encoding this receptor maps to human chromosome 6. This receptor is not related to the receptors for IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. At the protein level the murine and the human receptor show a sequence homology of 52 %. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma/ receptor complexes are rapidly internalized by endocytosis. In mouse/human cellular hybrids carrying human chromosome 6 and therefore expressing the receptor IFN-gamma binds to this receptor without eliciting any biological responses. The cells respond to IFN-gamma if human chromosome 21 is also introduced into these cells. These observations suggest that another still unknown protein encoded by a gene on human chromosome 21 is required to generate a functional receptor molecule. This protein interacts with the extracellular domain of the receptor and, like the 54 kDa molecule, is also species-specific. </p>
<p>A soluble form of the IFN-gamma receptor has been described also. Soluble receptors have been found also for IL1 (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), IL2, IL4, IL6, IL7, IGF and TNF-alpha. They probably function as physiological regulators of cytokine activities (see also: Cytokine inhibitors) by inhibiting receptor binding or act as transport proteins. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>IFN-gamma has antiviral and antiparasitic activities and also inhibits the proliferation of a number of normal and transformed cells. IFN-gamma synergises with TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in inhibiting the proliferation of various cell types. The growth inhibitory activities of IFN-gamma are more pronounced than those of the other interferons (see: IFN). However, the main biological activity of IFN-gamma appears to be immunomodulatory in contrast to the other interferons that are mainly antiviral. </p>
<p>In T-helper cells IL2 induces the synthesis of IFN-gamma and other cytokines. IFN-gamma acts synergistically with IL1 and IL2 and appears to be required for the expression of IL2 receptors on the cell surface of T-lymphocytes. Blocking of the IL2 receptor by specific antibodies also inhibits the synthesis of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma thus influences cell mediated mechanisms of cytotoxicity. IFN-gamma is a modulator of T-cell growth and functional differentiation. It is a growth-promoting factor for T-lymphocytes and potentiates the response of these cells to mitogens or growth factors. </p>
<p>The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 can be induced to differentiate by a number of stimuli. IFN-gamma, but not other interferons (see: IFN), specifically induces differentiation of these cells into monocytes. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma inhibits the growth of B-cells induced by IL4. IFN-gamma and Anti-Ig costimulate the proliferation of human B-cells but not of murine B-cells. IFN-gamma also inhibits the production of IgG1 and IgE elicited by IL4 in B-cells stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides. IFN-gamma regulates the expression of MHC class 2 genes and is the only interferon that stimulates the expression of these proteins. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma also stimulates the expression of Ia antigens on the cell surface, the expression of CD4 in T-helper cells, and the expression of high-affinity receptors for IgG (see also: CD16, CD32, CD64) in myeloid cell lines, neutrophils, and monocytes. In monocytes and macrophages IFN-gamma induces the secretion of TNF-alpha and the transcription of genes encoding G-CSF and M-CSF. In macrophages IFN-gamma stimulates the release of reactive oxygen species. IFN-gamma is involved also in processes of bone growth and inhibits bone resorption probably by partial inhibition of the formation of osteoclasts. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells of the arterial intima in vitro and in vivo and therefore probably functions as an endogenous inhibitor for vascular overreactions such as stenosis following injuries of arteries. IFN-gamma inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells and the synthesis of collagens by myofibroblasts. It thus functions as an inhibitor of capillary growth mediated by myofibroblasts and fibroblast growth factors (see: FGF) and PDGF. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma specifically induces the transcription of a number of genes. These genes contain regulatory DNA sequences within their promoter regions (ISRE; Interferon-stimulated response element; see: IRS, interferon response sequence) that function as binding sites for a number of transcription factors (see: GAF; gamma-Interferon activation factor). Some of these genes are expressed also in response to other interferons (see: IFN). </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The expression of IFN-gamma in the pancreas of transgenic mice has been shown to precipitate autoimmune diabetes. IFN-gamma produced locally in the pancreas of transgenic animals causes infiltration of lymphocytes and islet cell destruction. However, new islet cells are formed continuously from duct cells. The IFN-gamma induced islet neogenesis is similar to embryonic islet morphogenesis and offers a model system for studying factors modulating islet development. </p>
<p>Mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN-gamma gene have been developed by homologous recombination in ES cells. These knock-out animals develop normally and are healthy in the absence of pathogens. They are characterized, however, by an impaired production of macrophage antimicrobial products and reduced expression of macrophage major histocompatibility complex class 2 antigens. IFN-gamma deficient mice are killed by normally sublethal doses of the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium bovis. Splenocytes show uncontrolled proliferation in response to mitogen and alloantigen. After a mixed lymphocyte reaction, T-cell cytolytic activity is found to be enhanced against allogeneic target cells. Resting splenic natural killer cell activity is reduced in these mice. </p>
<p>Mice lacking the IFN-gamma receptor have been created also by homologous recombination. These animals have no overt anomalies and show normal cytotoxic and T-helper cell responses. However, mutant mice show an increased susceptibility to infection by Listeria monocytogenes and vaccinia virus. Immunoglobulin isotype analysis reveals that IFN-gamma is required for a normal antigen-specific immunoglobulin G2a response. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IFN-gamma can be detected by sensitive immunoassays. A specific ELISA test allows detection of individual cells producing IFN-gamma. Minute amounts of IFN-gamma can be detected indirectly by measuring IFN induced proteins such as Mx protein. The induction of the synthesis of IP-10 has been used also to measure IFN-gamma concentrations. A new bioassay employs induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity in 2D9 cells. A sensitive radioreceptor assay is also available. Lewis describes a bioassay based on induction of a reporter gene linked to a promoter element that responds to interferons (see: IFN). Production of the reporter gene product is dose-dependent in the range of 1 to approximately 100 U/mL of IFN and sensitivity is comparable to standard cytopathic effect assays. </p>
<p>NO production by RAW264.7 cells in response to murine IFN-gamma can be used also as a bioassay. Schein describes a quantitative rapid assay for IFN-gamma that is based on its ability to stimulate the activity of ds-RNases while inhibiting e. g., RNase A. </p>
<p>For an immunoassay allowing rapid determination of the rate of IFN-gamma production under conditions preventing consumption/degradation see also: Cytokine immunotrapping. </p>
<p>For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>Like the other interferons (see: IFN) IFN-gamma can be used as an antiviral and antiparasitic agent. IFN-gamma has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic polyarthritis. This treatment, which probably involves a modulation of macrophage activities, significantly reduces joint aches and improves various clinical parameters and allows reduction of corticosteroid doses. </p>
<p>In spite of the antiproliferative activities of IFN-gamma hopes that this interferon may be of use in the treatment of various malignancies have been disappointed. In many instances a combination treatment with other interferons (see: IFN) and cytokines, and also with chemotherapy has been moderately effective only. </p>
<p>IFN-gamma may be of value in the treatment of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. It has been shown also to reduce inflammation, clinical symptoms, and eosinophilia in severe atopic dermatitis. </p>
<p>Experiments are in progress to insert IFN-gamma genes into human tumor cells by genetic engineering as a means for generating autologous or HLA-matched allogeneic tumor cell vaccines for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma and other cancers. The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IFN-gamma gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>Treatment with IFN-gamma of a subgroup of patients with sepsis (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome) characterized by an impaired function of monocytes and a particular poor prognosis has been shown to augment functions of monocytes and to result in clearance of sepsis in the majority of these patients. </p>

<h2>IL12A</h2>
<p>[IL12-alpha] This term refers to the 35 kDa subunit of the heterodimeric protein IL12. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>IL12</h2>
<p>Interleukin-12. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>CLMF (cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor); NKSF (natural killer cell stimulatory factor); TcMF (CTL maturation factor; see: CLMF); TSF (T-cell stimulating factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL12 is secreted by peripheral lymphocytes after induction.IL12 is produced by activated hematopoietic phagocytic cells (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and by dendritic cells (Hsieh et al, 1993; Chan CW et al, 2006), but also by a variety of other cell types. The most powerful inducers of IL12 are bacteria, bacterial products, and parasites. IL12 is produced after stimulation with Phorbol esters or Calcium ionophore by human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The human lymphoblastoid cell line NC37 secretes large amounts of the uncomplexed 40 kDa subunit of IL12. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL12 is a heterodimeric 70 kDa glycoprotein (IL12-p70) consisting of a 40 kDa subunit (designated IL12B, IL12-beta, IL12-p40; 40 kDa subunit, 306 amino acids; 10 % carbohydrate) and a 35 kDa subunit (designated IL12A, IL12-alpha, IL12-p35; p35, 197 amino acids; 20 % carbohydrate) linked by disulfide bonds that are essential for the biological activity of IL12. IL12-p40 contains 10 cysteines and a binding site for heparin (see also: HBGF, heparin binding growth factors); p35 contains 7 cysteines. </p>
<p>p40 shows some homology with the extracellular domain of the receptor for IL6. p35 and IL6 probably are homologous. p40 has been shown to be a subunit of another composite cytokine, designated IL23. The p40 subunit can also form a homodimer, IL12-p80, which act as an IL12 and IL23 antagonist by competing at their receptors. </p>
<p>Lieschke et al (1997) have recently described the construction of bioactive murine and human IL12 fusion proteins combining the two IL12 subunits in a single molecule. This designer cytokine (see also: Muteins) retains antitumor activity in vivo. Anderson et al (1997) have described the construction of Flexi 12, a single chain protein retaining all of the biological characteristics of the dimeric recombinant IL12. </p>
<p>The p35 subunit of IL12 has been shown to heterodimerize with a protein known as EBI-3 (EBV induced gene-3). p28 is related to the p35 subunit of IL12 and is one subunit of the IL27 heterodimeric protein. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding the p40 subunit of IL12 (IL12B; see also: IL12-p40) maps to human chromosome 5q31-q33 in the same region that also harbors other cytokine genes (see: 5q minus syndrome). The gene encoding the p35 subunit of IL12 (IL12A; see also: IL12-p35) maps to human chromosome 3p12-q13.2. The expression of the two genes is regulated independently of each other </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL12 receptor (CD212) appears to be a single protein of approximately 110 kDa. Up to 1000-9000 high affinity IL12 receptors/cell are expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by various mitogens for T-cells or by IL2. IL12 receptors are present on activated T-cells expressing CD4 and CD8 and on activated CD56(+) natural killer cells. Resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tonsillar B-cells, or tonsillar B-cells activated by anti-IgM/Dx, anti-IgM/Dx + IL2, or SAC + IL2 do not express the receptor. High affinity IL12 receptors are expressed constitutively on a transformed marmoset NK-like cell line, HVS.SILVA 40. </p>
<p>Binding of IL12 to its receptor can be prevented by monoclonal antibodies directed against the p40 subunit which therefore contains the binding site. The p40 subunit of IL12 shows homology with the extracellular domain of the IL6 receptor. For a virus-encoded homolog of the p40 subunit see also: (EBI-3: EBV induced gene-3). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL12 is not active in murine lymphocytes. Hybrid heterodimers consisting of murine p35 and human p40 subunits retain bioactivity on murine cells; however, the combination of human p35 and murine p40 is completely inactive on murine cells. Murine IL12 is active on both murine and human lymphocytes. </p>
<p>The p40 subunit of murine IL12 subunit p40 (IL12-p40) has been shown to specifically antagonize the effects of the IL12 heterodimer in different assay systems and to function as an endogenous specific inhibitor for the IL12 heterodimer (Mattner et al, 1993). Some cells, such as microglia and macrfophages, have been shown to produce the IL12-p40 subunit, but not IL12, under certain conditions (Constantinescu et al, 1996; Mottonen et al, 2002; Fernandez-Lago et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL12 stimulates the proliferation of human lymphoblasts following cell activation by phytohemagglutinin. IL12 activates CD56(+) NK-cells, and this activity is blocked by antibodies specific for TNF-alpha. IL12 promotes specific allogenic CTL reactions. IL12 synergizes also with anti-CD3 antibodies and with allogeneic stimulation in mixed lymphocyte cultures in inducing T-cell proliferation. </p>
<p>In peripheral lymphocytes of the Th1 T-helper cell type IL12 induces the synthesis of IFN-gamma and IL2, and TNF. TNF-alpha also appears to be involved in mediating the effects of IL12 on natural killer cells since the effects of IL12 are inhibited by an antibody directed against TNF-alpha. IL12 and TNF-alpha are costimulators for IFN-gamma production with IL12 maximizing the IFN-gamma response; the production of IL12, TNF, and IFN-gamma is inhibited by IL10. In Th2 T-helper cells IL12 reduces the synthesis of IL4, IL5, and IL10. </p>
<p>IL12 synergises with suboptimal amounts of IL2 in promoting the proliferation of mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood and in promoting the generation of LAK cells (lymphokine activated killer cells). Picomolar concentrations of IL12 are as effective as nanomolar concentrations of IL2 in augmenting the cytolytic activity of natural killer cells expanded in vivo by IL2. IL12 also acts as a co-mitogen and potentiates the proliferation of resting peripheral cells induced by IL2. </p>
<p>IL12 is involved probably also in the selection of immunoglobulin isotypes. At picomolar concentrations IL12 markedly inhibits the synthesis of IgE by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with IL4 also in the presence of antibodies directed against IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Murine IL12 has been shown to alter CD4(+) subset differentiation and to be involved in the induction of protective immunity against intracellular parasitic infections in mice. It cures mice infected with Leishmania major. </p>
<p>IL12 enhances myelopoiesis of primitive bone marrow progenitor cells induced by SCF (stem cell factor) and synergizes with colony stimulating factors (see: CSF) to induce proliferation. IL12 also has synergistic effects on more committed bone marrow progenitors, synergising with IL3, IL11, or IL3 plus SCF. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of IL12 deficiency have been studied in transgenic knock-out mice generated from ES cells. IL12 deficient mice are impaired but not completely lacking in the ability to produce IFN-gamma following endotoxin administration and to mount a Th1 T-helper cell response in vivo. Secretion of IL4 is enhanced, while proliferation and secretion of IL2 and IL10 are normal following antigen stimulation. Delayed type hypersensitivity responses in mutant mice are significantly reduced while the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is not compromised in the absence of IL12. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL12 is of potential clinical interest since it allows to reduce doses of IL2 required for the generation of LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells). This may reduce the toxicity of higher doses of IL2 used for Adoptive immunotherapy. IL12 may be useful in expanding an antigen-specific T-cell population, as the culture of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with IL12 and low-dose IL2 leads to proliferation only in response to an antigen co-signal. IL12 has been shown to augment natural killer-cell mediated cytotoxicity in a number of conditions, including patients with hairy cell leukemia. </p>
<p>The ability of IL12 to induce the synthesis of IFN-gamma and to stimulate the proliferation of resting peripheral cells may be of interest also. </p>
<p>IL12 has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of experimental tumors in vivo and to have anti-angiogenic effects in vivo, which are, at least in part, mediated by IFN-gamma. IL12 therefore seems to be a potential candidate also for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent malignancies. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL12 can be assayed by its activity as NKSF (natural killer cell stimulatory factor) or CLMF (cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor). Human and porcine IL12 can be assayed in 10B10 cells. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. Murine IL12 can be measured in bioassays using the 2D6 cell line. </p>

<h2>IL1RN</h2>
<p>IL1 receptor antagonist. See: IL1ra. </p>

<h2>IL1ra</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>[IL1 receptor antagonist] The gene symbol IL1RN is used instead of IL1RA, which is used for the gene encoding one of the two forms of IL1 receptor. This factor has been called also IL1 inhibitor, IRAP (IL1 receptor antagonist protein), IL1 inhibitory activity, ILS. Another designation is IL1F3 [IL1 family member 3]. </p>
<p>A gene that may encode the receptor antagonist has been identified as MG50. An IL1 receptor antagonist isolated from the urine of a patient with monocytic leukemia (Seckinger et al, 1987) is identical with IL1ra. </p>
<p>A number of factors have been described that also inhibit the bioactivities of IL1. These factors are not identical with IL1ra and include contra-IL1, M20 interleukin-1 inhibitor, IL1 inhibitory protein, and IL1-L1. </p>
<p>The gene encoding IL1ra (152 amino acids) has been cloned from various sources. The human gene contains four exons and maps to chromosome 2q13-14.1 in the vicinity of the two genes encoding the two molecular forms of IL1 (Lennard et al, 1992; Steinkasserer et al, 1992). </p>
<p>IL1ra is synthesized as a precursor protein containing a classical secretory signal sequence of 25 amino acids that allows the secretion of the factor via the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway. Mouse, rat, human and rabbit IL1ra display approximately 75 % amino acid sequence homology (Carter et al, 1990; Eisenberg et al, 1990; Shuck et al, 1991; Cominelli et al, 1994; Zahedi et al, 1991). IL1ra shows approximately 30 % homology with IL1-beta at the protein level. </p>
<p>Several molecular forms of IL1ra have been identified. One isoform of 17 kDa, termed sIL1ra (s = soluble) or IL1ra1, contains a classical signal sequence and is secreted (Muzio et al, 1995). Two other isoforms, called collectively icIL1ra (intracellular IL1ra) or IL1ra2 (icIL1ra2) and IL1ra3 (icIL1ra3) have no signals sequence, are not secreted and remain strictly intracellular (Muzio et al, 1999; Malyak et al, 1998). These intracellular forms arise by alternative spicing and/or alternative translation initiation (Butcher et al, 1994; Malyak et al, 1998). It has been suggested that these intracellular isoforms may be storage forms that are released upon cell death to limit inflammation caused by cell debris (Muzio et al, 1999). Watson et al (1995) have suggested that the intracellular form of IL1ra functions as a unique intracellular inhibitor that alters IL1-inducible gene expression and attenuates IL1 responses at a point downstream of the initial IL1/IL1 receptor interaction. </p>
<p>IL1ra is found in the conditioned medium of a variety of cells and is produced by macrophages (Janson et al, 1991), monocytes (Lee et al, 1995; Wahl et al, 1993), neutrophils (Roberge et al, 1994; McColl et al, 1992), synovial and dermal fibroblasts (Krzesicki et al, 1993; Silvera et al, 1995), Sertoli cells (Huleihel et al, 2001), human microglial cells (Liu et al, 1998), corneal epithelial cells (Kennedy et al, 1995), retinal epithelial cells (Holtkamp et al, 1999), bronchial epithelial cells (Levine et al, 1997). The soluble form of IL1ra has been shown to be produced by hepatocytes, and to be regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1-beta, and a combination of IL1-beta and IL6) like other acute phase proteins (Gabay et al, 1997). IL4 and IL13 have been shown to amplify the stimulatory effect of IL1-beta on the production of soluble and intracellular forms of IL1ra by both human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cell (Gabay et al, 1999). Systemic inflammation has been shown to cause the production and secretion of the soluble form of IL1ra in the anterior pituitary, probably in response to IL1-beta originating from multiple sources (Wong et al, 1997). </p>
<p>The intracellular form of the receptor antagonist has been found in fibroblasts, monocytes, and neutrophils, keratinocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells (Krzesicki et al, 1993; Haskill et al, 1991; Muzio et al, 1994). icIL1ra is expressed upon cell activation by Jurkat cells, normal CD4(+) lymphocytes from peripheral blood, and by thymocytes, but not by CD8(+) T-cells (Frumento et al, 1997). </p>
<p>IL1ra is a physiologically important regulator of IL1 expression and of physiological responses caused by IL1. It does not seem to act in a species-specific manner (Lederer et al, 1994). </p>
<p>IL1ra functions as a competitive inhibitor of IL1 receptor binding in vitro and in vivo and antagonizes the activities of both molecular forms of IL1 without having agonist effects itself. Binding of IL1ra to the IL1 receptor does not initiate intracellular signal transduction processes normally occurring after engagement of the receptor with IL1 (Dripps et al, 1991; Evans et al, 1995; Granowitz et al, 1991). A serum binding factor for IL1ra, IL1raBF, is most likely a soluble form of the IL1 receptor type 1. </p>
<p>IL1ra inhibits the release of both forms of IL1, the secretion of IL2, and the expression of IL2 receptors on the cell surface (Conti et al, 1992). It also blocks the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis in synovial cells and the proliferation of thymocytes (Balavoine et al, 1986). IL1ra also inhibits the release of leukotriene B4 by human monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Conti et al, 1993). In isolated pancreatic islet cells IL1ra blocks the release of insulin (Dayer-Metroz et al, 1989). </p>
<p>Damtew et al (1993) have studied the effects of IL1ra on the synthesis of various acute phase proteins by human liver cells (Hep 3B cell line) treated with the conditioned medium from monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The authors observe differential responses and show that induction of C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A is essentially abolished, induction of complement component C3 and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 is moderately decreased and induction of fibrinogen is enhanced. Induction of alpha-1 protease inhibitor, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, and ceruloplasmin is not influenced. IL1ra partially blocks the downregulation of the negative acute phase proteins albumin and transferrin. Some acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1) have been shown to induce production of IL1ra by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Tilg et al, 1993). Synergistic effects are observed between these proteins and low concentrations of bacterial endotoxins. </p>
<p>Cells often produce simultaneously IL1 and IL1ra. Matsukawa et al (1997) have studied the tissue-specific production of IL1ra in rabbit tissues. They have reported that constitutive production of soluble IL1ra forms in the lung, liver, spleen, thymus, caecum, skin, kidney, heart, and brain and the simultaneous production of soluble and intracellular forms by thymus, caecum, skin and kidney. icIL1ra appears to be produced constitutively in mouse skin (Gabay et al, 1997). Constitutive expression of molecular forms of IL1ra has been observed in various tissues and cell lines. The regulated expression of IL1ra in various cell types has been shown to be influenced by cytokines and other factors and conditions. In human neutrophils the expression of IL1ra has been shown to be dependent on cell density (Hattar et al, 2001). IFN-gamma modulates the production of IL1ra in activated human neutrophils (McDonald et al, 1998). The synthesis of IL1ra has been shown to be inducible by IL1-beta administration in humans (Bargetzi et al, 1993). The epithelial cell lines A431 and HT29 express icIL1ra mRNA constitutively (Jenkins et al, 1997). The differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in vitro is associated with the constitutive synthesis of IL1ra. This synthesis is enhanced in the presence of GM-CSF (Janson et al, 1991). </p>
<p>In human monocytes the expression of IL1ra is enhanced by IL4, which at the same time also downregulates the production of IL1 and TNF-alpha (Numerof et al, 1992; Orino et al, 1992; Fenton et al, 1992). The effects of IL4 appears to be mediated by the signal transducer STAT6 (Ohmori et al, 1996). Jenkins et al (1993) have observed the induction of IL1ra in monocytes in response to IL1-alpha, IL3, IL4 and GM-CSF, while Wahl et al (1993) have reported that TGF-beta causes the sequential activation of IL1-beta and IL1ra. In human monocytes glucocorticoids inhibit IL1ra expression and secretion. The inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids is reversed by IFN-gamma through a mechanism dependent on endogenous IL1 production and by IL4 through a mechanism independent on IL1 (Kovalovsky et al, 1998). In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IL13 induces IL1ra synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Vannier et al, 1996). In synovial fibroblasts the synthesis of IL1ra is markedly enhanced by IL1, TNF-alpha, or PDGF (Martel-Pelletier et al, 1993). Krzesicki et al (1993) have shown that the expression of IL1ra in human synovial fibroblasts and dermal fibroblasts is regulated by IL1-alpha, TNF-alpha, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and that bFGF or PDGF-BB potentiate the effects of IL1-alpha. </p>
<p>IL6 has been shown to induce the synthesis and secretion of IL1ra in Peyer's patches in vivo and in macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro (Jordan et al, 1995). IL10 has been shown to upregulate IL1ra production from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Cassatella et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Subcutaneous administration of IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in humans has been shown to cause increases in circulating levels of IL1ra, which may contribute to the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects of IFN (Tilg et al, 1993). </p>
<p>TGF-beta-1 induces IL1ra production and gene expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (Di Febbo et al, 1998). </p>
<p>In human microglial cells IFN-beta induces IL1ra and augments IL1ra expression induced by LPS and IL4. IFN-gamma suppresses the expression of IL1ra caused by IFN-beta and IL4 (Liu et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Leptin can induce the expression and secretion of IL1ra in human monocytic cells. IL1ra has been shown also to antagonize the action of leptin at the hypothalamic level in rodents, thereby inducing leptin resistance and it has been suggested that IL1ra might contribute to the central resistance to leptin in obese patients (Meier et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Levine et al (1997) have reported that icIL1ra and IL1RA expression and secretion into the conditioned medium of in NCI-H292 cells (human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells is upregulated in response to IL4, IL13, IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Ohguchi et al (1998) have reported that Activin A enhances the production of IL1ra in activated THP-1 and U937 human monocytic cells. Berger et al (1993) have reported that GM-CSF and IL4 are inducers of IL1ra in U937 cells differentiated by phorbol esters. IL1-alpha, IL1-beta, and TGF-beta are weak inducers and IL2, PDGF, aFGF, bFGF, EGF, G-CSF, IL3, IL5, IL6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL1ra itself have no effect. </p>
<p>Sciacca et al (2000) have shown that IFN-beta is a potent inducer of IL1ra production in three myelomonocytic cell lines. </p>
<p>Jovcic et al (1996) have studied the recovery of hematopoiesis after sublethal irradiation of CBA mice and demonstrated that IL1ra decreases the number and the proportion of CFU-GM in the S phase in regenerating bone marrow, suppresses BFU-E, and enhances colony growth from CFU-E progenitor cells in a colony formation assay. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an IL1ra gene disruption have been studied in transgenic knock-out mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene (Hirsch et al, 1996). Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IL1ra gene have a lower body mass than wild-type control animals. They are more susceptible than controls to lethal doses of endotoxins (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome) but are less susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Serum levels of IL1 following an endotoxin challenge are decreased in animals lacking IL1ra. </p>
<p>Transgenic animals overproducing IL1ra are protected from the lethal effects of endotoxins but are more susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Serum levels of IL1 following an endotoxin challenge are increased in IL1ra overproducers. </p>
<p>Febrile responses elicited by central injection of human IL1-beta are abolished in these animals. Peripheral injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides in these animals causes fever and increases serum levels of IL1-beta and IL6 to the same extent as in control animals (Lundkvist et al, 1999). </p>
<p>Boggs et al (1995) have demonstrated that systemic production of biologically active human IL1ra can be obtained by retrovirus mediated gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells and that this level of expression and secretion into the serum is compatible with normal bone marrow engraftment, hematopoietic recovery, and survival of the lethally irradiated recipient mice. The authors suggest that these mice may be used as a model to examine the functions of IL1 and IL1ra and to determine the ability of IL1ra to reduce susceptibility to chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis as well as effects of aging such as bone degeneration. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The IL1 receptor antagonist gene has been shown to contain an 86 bp tandem repeat. Several studies suggest an association of allele 2 (IL1RN*2) of this polymorphism (Tarlow et al, 1993) with disease severity in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (Blakemore et al, 1994), ulcerative colitis (Mansfield et al, 1994), and alopecia areata (Tarlow et al, 1994). A significant association between this allele and diabetic nephropathy has been reported by Blakemore et al (1996). For an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the IL1ra gene see: DIRA [deficiency of the IL1 receptor antagonist].  </p>
<p>A recombinant form of IL1ra (Kineret) has been approved for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. IL1ra acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory substance and may be useful also in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diabetes. </p>
<p>IL1ra can prevent the systemic inflammatory response syndrome usually observed during Gram-negative sepsis in animal experiments (Wakabayashi et al, 1991; Ohlsson et al, 1990; Arendt et al, 1991). In an experimental study with human volunteers receiving intravenous injections of Gram-negative endotoxins, systemic administration of IL1ra has been shown to lessen the severity of symptoms (Van Zee et al, 1995). It has been suggested that IL1ra may improve hemorrhagic shock survival by preventing ATP depletion in vital organs (Pellicane et al, 1993). </p>
<p>In experimental animals, pretreatment with IL1ra has been shown to prevent death caused injections of TNF-alpha and IL1 (Everaerdt et al, 1994). Pretreatment with IL1ra also prevents the development of immune-complex induced colitis (Ferretti et al, 1994). </p>
<p>An imbalance between IL1ra and IL1 has been suggested to play a role in human inflammatory bowel disease (Casini-Raggi et al, 1995). </p>
<p>Graft-versus-host reactions have been shown also to be inhibited by administration of IL1ra (McCarthy et al, 1991; Antin et al, 1994). </p>
<p>IL1ra may be of clinical relevance also since it is known that IL1 synthesized by myeloma cells, Hodgkin lymphoma cells, B-cells, T-cells, and a variety of leukemic cell types in turn promotes the synthesis of colony stimulating factors (see: CSF). It has been shown that spontaneous as well as IL1 stimulated proliferation of acute myelogenous leukemia cells in vitro can be inhibited significantly by recombinant IL1ra (see also: Recombinant cytokines) in a dose dependent manner. This effect correlates with a reduction or disappearance in culture conditioned medium of GM-CSF, which is normally secreted by these cells. Northern blot analysis performed on freshly isolated, uncultured leukemic blasts demonstrates constitutive expression of the IL1-beta gene in 19 of 23 AML cases analyzed and simultaneous expression of IL1ra in 3 of 23 cases. An imbalanced secretion of IL1 and its natural receptor antagonist may, therefore, contribute to the unrestricted growth of AML cells (Rambaldi et al, 1993; Estrov et al, 1992). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to inhibit chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) colony growth in a dose-dependent fashion (Estrov et al, 1991). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown also to inhibit augmentation of metastasis induced by IL1 or bacterial lipopolysaccharides in a human melanoma/nude mouse system (Chirivi et al, 1993). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown also to block IL1 mediated induction of expression of human immunodeficiency virus in infected cells (Poli et al, 1994). HIV predominantly induces IL1ra over IL1 synthesis in human primary monocytes (Zavala et al, 1995). These effects may be critical in the control of inflammation associated with HIV infection. </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to suppress allergic eye disease in a mouse model, probably by a down-modulation of the recruitment of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells essential for the immunopathogenesis of ocular atopy (Keane-Myers et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to inhibit recurrence of disease after syngeneic pancreatic islet transplantation to spontaneously diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (Sandberg et al, 1997). </p>
<p>IL1ra has been shown to potentiate the stimulatory effect of human recombinant IL2 on Natural killer cell activity (Conti et al, 1991). </p>
<p>Abbate et al (2008) have reported that Anakinra inhibits cell death by apoptosis in experimental acute myocardial infarction. </p>

<h2>IL2RA</h2>
<p>[interleukin-2 receptor-alpha; IL2R-alpha; IL2 receptor-alpha] This is the approved gene symbol for one subunit of the receptor for IL2. The simple designation IL2R [interleukin-2 receptor] is used also. The receptor has been identified originally as TAC antigen. In older publications the has been referred to as TCGFR [T-cell growth factor receptor]. Because of disease associations with polymorphisms of the IL2RA gene, IL2RA is being referred to also as IDDM10. The mouse counterpart of IL2RA is known as Ly43 [lymphocyte antigen 43]. The rat counterpart is OX39. </p>
<p>In the nomenclature of CD antigens the receptor has been given the designation CD25. </p>
<p>The IL2RA gene has been cloned and characterized by Nikaido et al (1983), Leonard et al (1984), Ishida et al (1985), Leonard et al 1985). The IL2 receptor exists in 3 different forms: a high affinity dimer consisting of the alpha subunit IL2RA and the beta subunit (IL2RB), an intermediate affinity monomer (beta subunit), and a low affinity monomer (alpha subunit). IL2RA is not functional in IL2 internalization and signal transduction ((Gnarra et al, 1990). Signalling through the high and intermediate affinity forms requires a heterotrimeric complex formed by association with a gamma subunit (IL2RG; common gamma), which is shared also with receptors for other cytokines (Wang et al, 2005; Stauber DJ et al, 2006). </p>

<h2>IL16</h2>
<p>[Interleukin-16] This factor has been described originally as Lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF), which is produced by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells and acts as a chemoattractant for lymphocytes. The IL16 protein is derived from a much larger biologically inactive precursor (Baier et al, 1997; Bannert et al, 1996). Cleavage of bioactive secreted IL16 from its precursor is mediated by Caspase-3 (Wu et al, 1999). Bannert et al (1999) have cloned the murine gene. Keane et al (1998) have reported a high degree of structural and functional similarity between human and murine IL16. A high level of similarity at the amino acid sequence level is observed also between feline, human, and monkey IL16 (Leutenegger et al, 1998). Kurscher and Yuzaki (1999) have described the identification of NIL16 (Neuronal IL16) as a cytosolic long form of IL16 detected only in neurons. </p>
<p>Zhang et al (2001) have reported that the large proform of human IL16 (631 amino acids) is cleaved into two functional proteins, a C-terminal secreted cytokine and an N-terminal product, which localizes to the nucleus and affects the cell cycle. Chupp et al (1998) have shown that > 70 % of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells constitutively express IL16 protein, which is processed into bioactive secreted IL16 upon cell activation. </p>
<p>IL16 is secreted mainly by CD8(+) lymphocytes (Laberge et al, 1995; Schwab et al, 2001). The protein is produced by B-cells (Sharma et al, 2000; Kaser et al, 2000), neutrophils (Schwab et al, 2001), eosinophils (Laberge et al, 1999; Dunzendorfer et al, 2003; Lim et al, 1996), mast cells (Laberge et al, 1999; Middel et al, 2001; Rumsaeng et al, 1997), monocytes (Elssner et al, 2004), macrophages (Schwab et al, 2001; Reich et al, 2004), microglial cells (Schwab et al, 2001; Guo et al, 2004), dendritic cells (Kaser et al, 1999; Reich et al, 2002), lung epithelial cells (Yoshida et al, 2001; Arima et al, 1999; Little et al, 2003; Cheng et al, 2002; Bellini et al, 1993), keratinocytes (Frezzolini et al, 2004), thyrocytes (Gianoukakis et al, 2003), and fibroblasts from several tissues (Sciaky et al, 2000; Franz et al, 1998; Pritchard et al, 2004). Preformed bioactive IL16 has been shown to be released from CD8(+) T-cells, in contrast to CD4(+) cells, after activation with serotonin or histamine (Laberge et al, 1996, 1995; Gantner et al, 2002). </p>
<p>IL16 is a chemoattractant for a variety of cell types that express the cell surface antigen CD4 (Cruikshank et al, 2000), including CD4(+) T-cells (Cruikshank et al, 1994; Caufour et al, 2001; Hidi et al, 2000; Center and Cruikshank, 1982), Th1 cells (Lynch et al, 2003), dendritic cells (Kaser et al, 2000, 1999), monocytes (Cruikshank et al, 1987), macrophages (Laberge et al, 1999), eosinophils (Cheng et al, 2002; Rand et al, 1991, Ferland et al, 2004), Langerhans cells (Stoitzner et al, 2001). IL16 appears to signal via CD4 (Bandeira-Melo et al, 2002; Cruikshank et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Asadullah et al (2000) have implicated IL16 in growth and skin homing of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. </p>
<p>Mathy et al (200) have reported that CD14(+) CD4(+) monocytes and maturing macrophages, but not CD4(+) T-cells, secrete IL1-beta, IL6, IL15 and TNF-alpha in response to IL16 stimulation. IL16 upregulates expression of IL2 receptor and CD80, but downregulates CD4 and CD86 surface expression in monocyte-derived macrophages and also reduces expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 (Hermann et al, 1999). IL16 upregulates expression of IL2 receptor and CD83 in monocyte-derived dendritic cells but does not change levels of expression of CD4, CD80 and CD86 in these cells (Hermann et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL16 has been shown to upregulate IL2 receptor (CD25) on CD4(+) T-cells (Cruikshank et al, 1994, 1987), and thus influences cell activation of these cells, which depends on IL2. Ogasawara et al (1999) have reported that IL16 suppreses mitogen-induced production of IL2 by CD4(+) T-cells. IL16 also induces the transient loss of responsiveness via the T-cell receptor (Cruikshank et al, 1996; Theodore et al, 1996). IL16 acts as both primer and modulator of T-lymphocyte growth (Wilson et al, 2004). </p>
<p>Bandeira-Melo et al (2002) have reported that IL16 promotes release of leukotrienes and IL4 from human eosinophils. </p>
<p>IL16 has been shown to suppress the replication of HIV and SIV (Baier et al, 1995). Idziorek et al (1998) have reported that recombinant human IL16 inhibits HIV-1 replication and protects against cell death by apoptosis. Amiel et al (1999) have reported that IL16 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication in cells from infected subjects and that serum IL16 levels drop with disease progression. Truong et al (1999) have reported that IL16 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 entry and replication in macrophages and in dendritic cells. </p>
<p>Van Drenth et al (2000) have reported that IL16, the natural ligand of CD4, causes desensitization of one of the chemokine receptors, CXCR4, which is a coreceptor for CD4 for binding of HIV-1 gp120 protein. Mashikian et al (1999) have reported that IL16 also causes desensitization of the CCR5 receptor. </p>
<p>Pinsonneault et al (2001) have reported that IL16 inhibits IL5 production by antigen-stimulated T-cells in atopic subjects. </p>
<p>IL16 derived from CD8(+) T-cells has been implicated in the induction of CD4(+) T-cell abnormalities in systemic lupus erythematosus (Lee et al, 1998; Sekigawa et al, 2000). Upregulation of IL16 expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and could lead to increased secretion of other pro-inflammatory cytokines in Inflammatory bowel disease (Seegert et al, 2001). Hessel et al (1998) have reported that IL16 plays an important role in airway hyper-responsiveness and upregulation of IgE, but is not important for eosinophil accumulation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Franz et al (1998) have implicated IL16 in rheumatoid arthritis since IL16, produced by synovial fibroblasts, mediates chemoattraction for CD4(+) T-cells in rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p> IL16 is generally assumed to utilize CD4 as a receptor (Center et al, 1996). Liu et al (1999) have identified the CD4 domain required for IL16 binding and lymphocyte activation. However, Mathy et al (2000) have reported that CD4 is not required for the functional activity of IL16 in murine monocytes. Their observation that cells from CD4 knock-out mice are as responsive to IL16 as their CD4 wild-type equivalents and that the effects of IL16 cannot be inhibited by soluble CD4 in these mice suggests that another molecule acts as the major receptor. Stoitzner et al (2001) have reported also that IL16 supports the migration of Langerhans cells through mechanisms partly independent of CD4. </p>

<h2>IL18</h2>
<p>[Interleukin-18] The gene encoding this nonglycosylated protein of 24 kDa has been identified originally as IGIF (IFN-gamma inducing factor). It encodes an inducer of IFN-gamma production by T-cells (Okamura et al, 1995; Micalef et al, 1997) and natural killer cells (Tsutsui et al, 1996) that is a more potent inducer than IL12. Alternative designations are IL1-gamma and IL1F4. Human recombinant IL18 is marketed as Iboctadekin (GlaxoSmithKline). </p>
<p>The proteins from murine (192 amino acids) and human IL18 (193 amino acids) sources show 65 % homology. Rat and murine IL18 display 91 % homology (nucleotide and amino acid level). IL18 does not display sequence similarities to other known proteins but a survey of the sequence by fold recognition methods demonstrates that it belongs to the IL1 family of cytokines (Ushio et al, 1996). </p>
<p>IL18 lacks a classical signal sequence necessary for secretion (Okamura et al, 1995; Ushio et al, 1996; Gu et al, 1997). IL18 is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor protein that has limited biological activity. The proform of IL18 is processed by one of the caspases, Caspase-1, to generate the 18 kDa bioactive molecule (Gu et al, 1997; Ghayur et al, 1997). Other proteases such as neutrophil proteinase-3 (Myeloblastin) may provide activation pathways that are independent of caspases (Sugawara et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Kikkawa et al (2001) have demonstrated that monocytes and macrophages produce large amounts of various IL18 species. Some of them are inactive dimers while others have weak IFN-gamma inducing activity. IL18 type 2 is a fragment of IL18 that possesses little activity as an inducer of IFN-gamma. This variant is bound to IgM in plasma and is found at high levels in approximately 30 % of normal subjects (Shida et al, 2001). The authors suggest that this variant may play some roles in the development of Th2 cell responses involving IgE production in association with atopic lesions. </p>
<p>The human gene has been mapped to chromosome 11q22.2-q22.3 (Nolan et al, 1998). </p>
<p>IL18 is produced during the acute immune response by macrophages and immature dendritic cells. IL18 is expressed by a variety of immune and non-immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages (Okamura et al, 1995; Ushio et al, 1996), Kupffer cells (Okamura et al, 1995; Seki et al, 2001), T-cells and B-cells (Nakanishi et al, 2001); Klein et al, 1999), dendritic cells (Stober et al, 2001; Gardella et al, 2000; Stoll et al, 1998; de Saint-Vis et al, 1998), osteoblasts (Udagawa et al, 1997; Torigoe et al, 1997), epidermal keratinocytes (Stoll et al, 1997), intestinal epithelial cells (Takeuchi et al, 1997; Pizarro et al, 1999), corneal epithelial cells (Burbach et al, 2001), glucocorticoid-secreting adrenal cortex cells (Conti et al, 1997), astrocytes, and microglial cells (Conti et al, 1999; Suk et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Acute cold stress strongly induces IGIF gene expression in rats (Conti et al, 1997). rat IGIF has been shown to be expressed in the adrenal gland of reserpine-treated rats (Conti et al, 1997). Park et al (2001) have reported an enhanced IL18 expression in common skin tumors. </p>
<p>IL18 is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activities of IL18 appear to be species specific. An important function of IL18 is the regulation of functionally distinct subsets of T-helper cells required for cell mediated immune responses (Nakanishi et al, 2001). IL18 functions as a growth and differentiation factor for Th1 cells. IL18 upregulates FAS ligand mediated cytotoxic activitiy of murine natural killer cells (Tao et al, 1996; Tsutsui et al, 1996). IL18 is part of a complex regulatory circuit involved in causing cell death by apoptosis. The expression of the receptor for FAS ligand, FAS antigen, is upregulated by IFN-gamma (Watanabe-Fukunaga et al, 1992) that itself is induced by IL18. </p>
<p>IL18 is a pleiotropic cytokine. IL18 induces activated B-cells to produce IFN-gamma that inhibits IgE production (Yoshimoto et al, 1997). IL18 has been shown to strongly augment the production of IFN-gamma by T-cells and NK-cells (Micallef et al, 1996). The ability of IL18 to enhance IFN-gamma production by NK-cells is dependent on the presence of IL12 (Walker et al, 1999). IGIF enhances T-cell proliferation apparently through an IL2 dependent pathway (Micallef et al, 1996). </p>
<p>Park et al (2001) have shown that IL18 is an angiogenic mediator that induces migration of microvascular endothelial cells and causes tube formation by endothelial cells in a matrigel matrix in vitro. It also induces angiogenesis in vivo in a matrigel plug assay. </p>
<p>IL18 has been found to enhance also the production of GM-CSF. Udagawa et al (1997) have shown that IL18 produced by osteoblastic stromal cells acts via GM-CSF and not via IFN-gamma to inhibit osteoclast formation. </p>
<p>Morel et al (2001) have observed that IL18 induces the expression of the CXC-Chemokines IL8, MGSA, ENA-78 in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast. It does not appear to induce the production of MIP-1-alpha. </p>
<p>IL18 inhibits osteoclast formation via T-cell production of GM-CSF (Udagawa et al, 1997; Horwood et al, 1998, 2001). </p>
<p>By stimulating immune cells IL18 also exibits a strong antitumoral activity, protecting experimental animals against repeated challenges with tumor cells cells (Micallef et al, 1997). In an attempt of cancer gene therapy, Osaki et al (1999) have introduced the IL18 gene into murine tumors and observed a potent antitumor effects mediated by local expression of IL18. Kishida et al (2001) have reported that the simultaneous expression of IL18 and IL12 by engineered melanoma cells induces significant antitumor effects in mice. </p>
<p>A protective effect of IL18 against the development of chronic graft-versus-host disease in the mouse has been demonstrated by Okamoto et al (2000). Reddy et al (2001) have shown that the inhibition of Il18 accelerates mortality caused by acute graft-versus-host disease in a bone marrow transplant model and that is due to increased FAS antigen mediated donor T-cell apoptosis. Leung et al (2001) have demonstrated that IL18 activates human neutrophils and that IL18 administration promotes accumulation of neutrophils in vivo, whereas IL18 neutralization suppresses the severity of footpad inflammation following carrageenan injection. </p>
<p>Abnormal expression of IL18 has been observed in autoimmune non obese diabetic (NOD) mice and to be closely associated with development of diabetes (Rothe et al, 1997). Pizarro et al (1999) have detected increased IL18 mRNA and protein expression that intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells in Crohn's disease tissue express elevated levels of IL18. </p>
<p>IL18 mediates infection resistance against a variety of pathogens, mainly due to the induction of IFN-gamma expression. IL18 plays a critical role in the defense against intracellular bacteria, including Listeria, Shigella, Salmonella, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Biet et al, 2002). Liver damage in mice caused by treatment with Propionibacterium acnes and septic shock induced by challenge with lipopolysaccharides can be prevented by administration of anti-IGIF antibodies (Okamura et al, 1995). </p>
<p>IL18, together with other cytokines, may play a role in the development of hepatic metastases of melanoma in vivo through upregulating the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and melanoma cell adherence (Vidal-Vanaclocha et al, 2000). </p>
<p>IL18 appears to play a direct neuromodulatory role in synaptic plasticity and impairs long-term potentiation and NMDA receptor mediated transmission in the rat hippocampus in vitro (Curran et al, 2001). </p>
<p>The expression of functional IL18 and IL18 receptor on human atheroma-associated endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mononuclear phagocytes, and its ability to induce IFN-gamma expression in smooth muscle cells, suggests a paracrine pro-inflammatory role in atherogenesis (Gerdes et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Ogura et al (2001) have reported that IL18 stimulates CD4(+) T-cells and macrophages to secrete IL5, GM-CSF, IL6, and G-CSF in the absence of IL12, which in turn induces hematopoietic cell proliferation causing neutrophilia and eosinophilia in mice. </p>
<p>Wang et al (2001) have reported that vaccination with IL18 gene-modified, superantigen-coated tumor cells elicits potent antitumor immune responses. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Wei et al (1999, 2001) have generated transgenic knock-out mice lacking expression of IL18. These mice are viable and fertile. There are no evident histopathologic abnormalities. The animals are susceptible to infections by the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. Infected mice produce significantly lower levels of IFN-gamma and larger amounts of IL4 compared with similarly infected heterozygous or wild-type mice. Infections of knock-out mice with Staphylococcus aureus, are less severe than similar infections in wild-type mice. Mutant mice develop significantly more severe septic arthritis than control mice. This is accompanied by a reduction in the levels of antigen induced splenic T-cell proliferation, decreased synthesis of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but increased production of IL4. </p>
<p>Wei et al (1999, 2001) also have reported a reduced incidence and severity of collagen induced arthritis in mice lacking IL18 and that treatment with recombinant IL18 completely reverses the disease of the IL18 knock-out mice to that of the wild-type mice. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>A functional component of the human receptor for IGIF has been identified in the Hodgkin's disease cell line, L428 (Torigue et al, 1997). The cells express approximately 18,000 binding sites/cell. The dissociation constant of IL18 binding to L428 cells is about 18.5 nM. The cloned receptor component was shown to be identical with IL1Rrp [IL1 receptor-related protein). Expression of the IL1Rrp cDNA in COS-1 cells has been shown to confer IL18 binding properties on the cells and the capacity for signal transduction. This receptor is being referred to now as IL18R1 [interleukin-18 receptor-1; IL18R-alpha] or IL18RA [interleukin-18 receptor-alpha].  </p>
<p>Debets et al (2000) have shown that a highly specific IL18 receptor is formed together with IL1RAPL [IL1 receptor accessory protein-like]. This receptor is the same as IL18RAP [IL18 receptor accessory protein], which is the approved gene symbol for a protein that has been described also as AcPL [accessory protein-like subunit]. The protein is being referred to also as IL18RB [IL18R-beta].  </p>
<p>Some of the bioactivities of IL18 are modulated by a secreted binding protein, IL18BP [IL18 binding protein]. </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>Taniguchi et al (1997) have developed an ELISA (see also: cytokine assays) specific for human IL18 ELISA. This assay has a minimum detection limit of 10 pg/mL and does not react with heat-denatured human IL18. There is no cross-reactivity with other cytokines. Taniguchi et al (1998) have established also cells useful for bioassays of murine IL18 by transfection of the murine IL18 receptor gene into KG-1 cells. Konishi et al (1997) have described sensitive bioassays for human IL18 using the human myelomonocytic cell line, KG-1. </p>

<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL3 is produced mainly by T-cells following cell activation by antigens and mitogens, but also by keratinocytes, NK-cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, and monocytes. Some cell lines produce IL3 constitutively. Substances that inhibit the activation of T-lymphocytes such as glucocorticoids or CsA (Cyclosporin A) also inhibit the production of IL3. For the constitutive synthesis of IL3 see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). </p>
<p>IL3 may be associated with the extracellular matrix in the form of complexes with heparan sulfate/proteoglycan. It can thus be stored in a biologically inactive form but it may exert juxtacrine activities also. The molecular mechanisms underlying the release from extracellular matrix stores is still unknown. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>Human IL3 is a protein of 15-17 kDa (133 amino acids). It is synthesized as a precursor containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 19 amino acids. IL3 contains two putative glycosylation sites at positions 15 and 70 and contains a single disulfide bond (Cys16/84). The analysis of bacterial-derived recombinant IL3 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) shows that glycosylation is not required for the activity of IL3. </p>
<p>IL3 sequences are evolutionarily less well conserved. Human and murine IL3 show approximately 29 % homology at the protein level while murine and rat IL3 show approximately 54 % homology. IL3-alpha and IL3-beta are two isoforms of rat IL3. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL3 has a length of approximately 2.2 kb and contains five exons. The gene maps to human chromosome 5q23-31. Murine and human IL3 genes structurally resemble each other but at the nucleotide level the homology is approximately 49 %. The murine IL3 gene maps to chromosome 17. </p>
<p>The human IL3 gene is located in close vicinity to other cytokine genes, including those encoding GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL4 and IL5 The distance between the IL3 and the GM-CSF gene is approximately 9 kb with the IL3 gene on the 5'side of the GM-CSF gene. Deletions of the IL3/GM-CSF locus are observed frequently in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (see also: 5q minus syndrome). </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>IL3 receptors are expressed on macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, basophils, bone marrow progenitor cells, and various myeloid leukemia cells. </p>
<p>IL3/receptor complexes have a Kdis of 10**-9 - 10**-10 M. Binding of IL3 to its receptor causes specific phosphorylation of a 150 kDa membrane glycoprotein. </p>
<p>Biological activities are also detected at the concentration range of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M which suggests the existence either of other high affinity receptor conformations or other receptors. </p>
<p>The high affinity IL3 receptor is formed by aggregation of the IL3-specific subunit of the receptor with another subunit called GM-Rbeta which constitutes the larger subunit of the receptor for GM-CSF and is involved also as a subunit in the formation of IL5 receptors (see also: AIC2A). This subunit which is common to all three receptors is called also Beta c or common beta. In the nomenclature of CD antigens this common protein has been given the designation CD131. See also the Transgenic /Knock-out/Antisense Studies section of this entry for details on mice not expressing the common beta subunit of the receptor complex. </p>
<p>Binding of IL3 to its receptor causes the phosphorylation of the receptor and also of some other cytoplasmic proteins (p70, p56, p38) and also activates protein kinase C in IL3 dependent cell lines (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). The non-receptor tyrosine kinase lyn has been implicated in IL3 mediated signal transduction processes (see also: PTK; protein tyrosine kinase). </p>
<p>For a protein involved in signal transduction see also: CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL3 are species-specific. The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL3 has been described. IL3 is a growth factor that establishes the link between the immune system and the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis). It supports the proliferation and development of almost all types of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: CFU). In rhesus monkeys IL3 causes the expansion of all types of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL3 also supports the differentiation of early non-lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitor cells into colonies of granulocytes, macrophages, erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and mast cells (see also: Colony formation assay). IL3 also stimulates clonal growth of non-hematopoietic stromal cells in bone marrow cultures (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture). IL3 is one of the priming factors for hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and in vivo (see also: cell activation) that makes the cells responsive to later-acting factors such as Epo, GM-CSF and IL6. IL3 also induces the increased expression of receptors for colony stimulating factors (see: CSF). At pico- to nanomolar concentrations IL3 is a chemoattractant for eosinophils and also influences the chemotactic behavior of these cells in response to other chemotactically active factors (see also: Chemotaxis). </p>
<p>IL3 does not appear to be an obligatory factor in normal hematopoiesis. The athymic nude mouse (see also: Immunodeficient mice) which lacks T-cells responsible for IL3 production displays a normal pattern of hematopoietic development. In the lymphoid lineage IL3 supports the growth of preB-cells. </p>
<p>Experiments with an oncogene encoding a tyrosine-specific protein kinase show that the expression of the oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinase abolishes IL3 requirements (and also GM-CSF and IL4 requirements) in factor-dependent cells. The exact mechanism by which these factors regulate proliferation and differentiation is still unknown. </p>
<p>IL3 induces the proliferation of mast cells and macrophages and causes the synthesis of histamines by mast cells and phagocytosis in macrophages. In mast cells IL3 prevents the expression of MHC class 2 molecules normally induced by IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>IL3 induces the expression of complement factor C3a receptors in basophils at nanomolar concentrations. A transient stimulation by IL3 is required to make basophils responsive for further cell activation by IL8 which by itself does not possess histamine releasing activity. Tissue mast cells do not respond to IL3. In macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. IL3 significantly enhances the secretion of other cytokines including IL1, IL6 and TNF. In vitro IL3 also stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes. This observation has been made also in rhesus monkeys treated with recombinant IL3 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) but at present it is unclear whether IL3 is involved in skin reactions associated with the growth of keratinocytes and acanthosis. </p>
<p>IL3 also specifically induces the production of enzymes involved in cellular metabolism, differentiation and DNA/RNA metabolism. Among other things IL3 induces the expression of 20-alpha-steroid dehydrogenase and of histidine and Ornithine decarboxylase. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL3 in astrocytes have been studied in transgenic mice expressing a murine glial fibrillary acidic protein fusion gene. Chiang et al (1996) have shown that chronic CNS production of low levels of IL3 promotes the recruitment, proliferation and activation of microglial cells in white matter regions with consequent primary demyelination and motor disease. These features resemble those found in human inflammatory demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis and HIV leukoencephalopathy. </p>
<p>Robb et al (1995) have created transgenic knock-out mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding the common beta subunit (beta C) of the GM-CSF, IL3, and IL5 receptor complexes. Homozygous deletion mutants exhibit normal development and survive to young adult life. They develop pulmonary peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis. Eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone marrow of homozygous deletion mutants are reduced, while other hematological parameters are normal. Bone marrow cells from homozygous deletion mutants do not show high-affinity binding of GM-CSF, while cells from heterozygous animals show an intermediate number of high-affinity receptors. In clonal cultures of bone marrow cells derived from homozygous deletion mutants, even high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL5 do not stimulate colony formation (see also: Colony formation assay). Differences in the systemic clearance and distribution of GM-CSF between mutant and wild-type littermates are not observed. </p>
<p>Nishinakamura et al (1996) have crossed beta-c mutant mice with mice deficient for IL3. The double-mutant mice lacking all IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 functions are apparently normal and fertile. The animals show the same reduced numbers of eosinophils and a lack of eosinophilic response to parasites as beta-c mutant mice. The immune response of the double mutant mice to Listeria mono-cytogenes is normal. Hematopoietic recovery after treatment with Fluorouracil is also normal. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanism to produce blood cells that do not depend on the presence of IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL3 can be detected in bioassays employing responsive cell lines (see: AML-193; 32D; B6SUt-A; B13; Da; Ea3.17; FDCP1; GF-D8; IC-2; KMT-2; L138.8A; LyD9; MO7E; NFS-60; PT-18; TALL-103; TF-1; TMD2; UT-7). A sensitive ELISA test for IL3 is also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL3 alone or in combination with other colony stimulating factors (see also: CSF) or Epo is probably useful in the reconstitution of bone marrow and in stimulating erythropoiesis (see also: hematopoiesis). IL3 also appears a valuable substance in view of its ability to stimulate the proliferation of very immature hematopoietic progenitor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM, which can be enhanced even more by simultaneous administration of other factors such as GM-CSF. These effects can be exploited in the generation of stem cells, allowing stem cell separation and re-infusion into patients undergoing, for example, intensive chemotherapy. It may be useful also in the treatment of anemic patients with congenital defects such as BFU-E deficiency. IL3 appears to be of limited benefit in patients who are severely aplastic after autologous bone marrow transplantation and have very low levels of bone marrow progenitors. </p>
<p>In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, who frequently present with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia due to defective maturation of bone marrow cells initial phase I/II trials with IL3 have demonstrated an increase in the counts of neutrophils in 59 %, of counts of platelets in 34 %, and in counts of reticulocytes in 25 % of the patients. </p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that IL3 administered subcutaneously appears to be an interesting hematopoietic growth factor (see also: Hematopoietins) for reduction of chemotherapy induced myelotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. </p>
<p>IL3 is probably of major importance in the treatment of thrombopenias, secondary hematopoietic insufficiencies and certain types of refractory anemia. The administration of IL3 followed by subsequent course of IL6 greatly improves platelet counts. This combination, therefore, may allow an effective control of thrombocytopenias and severe bleeding frequently associated with this condition. </p>
<p>Some monocytic and myeloid leukemias the growth of which is inhibited almost completely by antibodies directed against IL3 have been described in the mouse These leukemias are characterized by the overexpression of the IL3 gene. In humans, however, such cases have not been described to date. A number of malignant myeloid and lymphoid leukemias respond to IL3. In vitro ALL blast cells can be made more responsive to cytotoxic drugs such as cytosine arabinoside by treatment with IL3. At present it is unclear whether this also occurs in vivo. </p>

See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL6 is produced by many different cell types. The main sources in vivo are stimulated monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Macrophages, T-cells and B-lymphocytes, granulocytes, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, mast cells, glial cells, and keratinocytes also produce IL6 after stimulation. Glioblastoma cells constitutively produce IL6 and the factor can be detected also in the cerebrospinal fluid. Human milk also contains IL6 (see: MGF, milk growth factor). </p>
<p>Cardiac myxomas and cervical and bladder carcinomas secrete large amounts of IL6 into the conditioned medium. Very high levels of IL6 are also detected in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but not with osteoarthritis. </p>
<p>Physiological stimuli for the synthesis of IL6 are IL1, bacterial endotoxins, TNF, PDGF, and Oncostatin M. In fibroblasts the synthesis of IL6 is stimulated by IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, PDGF, and viral infections. In thymic stromal cells the synthesis of IL6 can be induced by NGF. IL6 can also stimulate or inhibits its own synthesis, depending upon the cell type. For the constitutive production of IL6 see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of IL6 is induced by IL17. </p>
<p>IL6 is produced also in the anterior lobe of the pituitary and can be induced by bacterial endotoxins and all substances elevating intracellular levels of cAMP (prostaglandin E2, forskolin, cholera toxin). VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) also stimulates the synthesis of IL6 in the anterior lobe of the pituitary while Growth hormone releasing hormone is inactive. Macrolide antibiotics spiramycin and erythromycin stimulate the synthesis of IL6 in human monocytes following cell activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharides but not the synthesis of IL1 or TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>Glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of IL6 and IL4 or TGF-beta reduce its synthesis. The synthesis of IL6 by human alveolar macrophages is inhibited by IL4. </p>
<p>In serum IL6 is complexed with Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Alpha2M) which protects IL6 from cleavage by proteases and possibly functions as a transport protein. </p>
<p>The release of IL6 from isolated rat macrophages in culture is stimulated by Histogranin. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL6 is a protein of 185 amino acids glycosylated at positions 73 and 172. It is synthesized as a precursor protein of 212 amino acids. Monocytes express at least five different molecular forms of IL6 with molecular masses of 21.5-28 kDa. They mainly differ by post-translational alterations such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. </p>
<p>IL6 isolated from various cell types shows some microheterogeneity in its N-terminus. A 42-45 kDa form has been observed in plasma that is probably complexed with a carrier protein Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Alpha2M) Murine and human IL6 show 65 % sequence homology at the DNA level and 42 % homology at the protein level. For a truncated form of IL6 with antagonist activities see: tIL6. </p>
<p>IL6 is a member of a family of cytokines, which also includes LIF, CNTF, Oncostatin M, IL11, and CT-1. All known members of the IL6 cytokine family induce hepatic expression of acute phase proteins. </p>
<p>IL6-Delta-4 is an isoform constituting a splice variant of IL6 that lacks exon 4. The protein lacks two amino acids necessary for IL6 homodimerization and two of six amino acids required for interaction with IL6 receptor-beta. This isoform forms a stable complex with IL6 receptor-alpha. IL6-Delta-4 may compete with native IL6 for binding to the IL6 receptor-alpha and regulate IL6 bioactivities because of its inability to transmit IL6 receptor-beta-mediated signaling (Bihl et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Fischer et al (1997) have described the construction of a stable and highly bioactive designer cytokine (see also: Muteins) consisting of a fusion protein between IL6 and a soluble IL6 receptor. This hybrid, designated H-IL6 (Hyper-IL6), has been used for the expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells) and is useful in cases in which cells do not respond to IL6 but require a stable complex consisting of IL6 and a soluble IL6 receptor. </p>
<p>For a human recombinant fusion protein consisting of IL6 and IL2 see: CH925. For a virus-encoded homolog of IL6 see: viral IL6. </p>
<p>For a series of artificial cytokines derived from sequences of human IL6 and GCSF (termed Harlequin molecules) see: Muteins. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL6 gene has a length of approximately 5 kb and contains five exons. It maps to human chromosome 7p21-p14 between the markers D7S135 and D7S370. The murine gene maps to chromosome 5. The nucleotide sequences of IL6 and G-CSF genes resemble each other in a way suggesting a possible evolutionary relationship. </p>
<p>The IL6 gene promoter contains many different regulatory elements allowing the induction of expression by various stimuli, including glucocorticoids and cAMP (see also: gene expression). The NF-kappa-B binding site is responsible in non-lymphoid cells for the induction of the IL6 gene expression by IL1 or TNF. In lymphoid cells a factor related to the rel oncogene (IL6kB binding factor II) functions as a repressor that prevents the interaction of transcription factors with the IL6-kappa-B binding site. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL6 receptor is expressed on T-cells, mitogen-activated B-cells, peripheral monocytes and some macrophage- and B-cell derived tumor cell types. It is not expressed in resting B-cells but in resting T-cells. In hepatocytes the IL6 receptor expression is enhanced after treatment with IL6 or IL1. In several cell types the expression of the IL6 receptor is also enhanced by glucocorticoids. For the over-expression of the IL6 receptor see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). The IL6 receptor gene maps to human chromosome 1q21. </p>
<p>The IL6 receptor is a strongly glycosylated protein of 80 kDa and a length of 449 amino acids. It has been designated CD126. It is synthesized as a precursor of 468 amino acids. The molecular structure resembles that of receptors for M-CSF, PDGF and IL1 in that the receptor contains an immunoglobulin-like sequence domain in the aminoterminal region of the extracellular receptor domain. </p>
<p>The intracellular domain of the IL6 receptor has a length of approximately 82 amino acids and does not show any homology to other proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. </p>
<p>Two different forms of the receptor have been described that bind IL6 with different affinities (Kdis = 10**-9 and 10**-11 M) and most likely arise by post-translational modification of the same receptor protein. </p>
<p>Biological activities of IL6 have been found also at concentrations of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M suggesting either the existence of other high-affinity receptor conformations or the existence of further receptor molecules with higher affinities. </p>
<p>IL6 receptor mediated signal transduction involves protein kinase C and also adenylate cyclase. </p>
<p>The complex formed between IL6 and its receptor associates with a transmembrane glycoprotein, gp130 (918 amino acids; cytoplasmic domain of 277 amino acids), that is involved in signal transduction. Binding of IL6 to its receptor leads to disulfide-linked homodimerization of gp130 and the associated activation of a tyrosine kinase as the first step of signal transduction. gp130 is expressed also in cells that do not express IL6 receptors. It has been found to be a component of other receptors, including those for IL11, LIF, Oncostatin M, and CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor), and CT-1. This explains why LIF, CNTF and IL6 share many biological activities although the factors themselves are not related to each other. A factor resembling STAT proteins, termed LIL factor, has been found to be involved in signaling pathways of IL6, and also of IL1 and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p>A soluble form of the IL6 receptor (see: IL6R-SUP; IL6 receptor soluble urinary protein) has been described also that also interacts with gp130. These soluble receptors probably function as physiological regulators of cytokine activities (see also: Cytokine inhibitors) by inhibiting receptor binding or act as transport proteins. Similar soluble receptors or binding proteins have been described also for IL1 (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), IL2, IL4, IL7, TNF-alpha, IGF, and IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Some cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells and neuronal cells, are only responsive towards a combination of IL6 and soluble IL6 receptor but not to IL6 alone. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL6 is biologically active in monkeys, rats, and mice. Murine IL6 is not active in human cells. </p>
<p>The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL6 has been described. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine influencing antigen-specific immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It is one of the major physiological mediators of acute phase reaction. </p>
<p>In hepatocytes IL6 in combination with glucocorticoids induces the synthesis of metallothioneins and increases intracellular zinc levels, thus preventing CCL4 induced hepatotoxicity. </p>
<p>IL6 is a that promotes survival of cholinergic neurons in culture (see also: neurotrophic factors). Some neuronal cell lines can be induced to differentiate by IL6. For other neurotrophic factors see also: Neurotrophins. </p>
<p>IL6, like IL1, stimulates the synthesis of ACTH (Corticotropin) in the pituitary. Glucocorticoids synthesized in response to ACTH inhibit the production of IL6, IL1 and TNF in vivo, thus establishing a sort of negative feedback loop between the immune system and neuroendocrine functions. In astrocytes IL6 induces the synthesis of NGF. </p>
<p>IL6 is a B-cell differentiation factor in vivo and in vitro (see also: BCDF) and an activation factor for T-cells (see also: cell activation). In the presence of IL2 IL6 induces the differentiation of mature and immature T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells. IL6 also induces the proliferation of thymocytes and probably plays a role in the development of thymic T-cells. </p>
<p>IL6 is capable of inducing the final maturation of B-cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells if the cells have been pre-activated by IL4. In B-cells IL6 stimulates the secretion of antibodies to such a degree that serum IgG1 levels can rise 120-400-fold. </p>
<p>IL6 at concentrations of only 0.002 ng/mL is one of the major autocrine growth modulator for many human myelomas. The growth of these cells can be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against IL6. It can be inhibited also by the introduction of antisense RNA against IL6 or by IL4. The growth-inhibitory effects of corticosteroids on myeloma cells is probably due to the steroid induced reduction in the expression of IL5. The growth of human IL6 dependent myeloma cells (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) can be inhibited also by IFN-gamma. IL6 may function also as an autocrine growth modulator for other tumor types, some of which have been found to secrete IL6 constitutively. IL6 has been shown to be an autocrine modulator of growth for in vitro cervical tumor cell growth. On the other hand IL6 blocks the growth of some solid tumors such as mammary carcinomas, cervical carcinomas, human lung cancer cell lines, histiocytic lymphomas, and melanomas. The growth-inhibitory effects are probably compensated by an IL6 induced reduction in cell-to-cell interactions, which also promotes increased metastasizing potential. </p>
<p>IL6 has been found to be expressed in murine blastocysts before hematopoietic differentiation hematopoietic growth factor. This suggests that IL6 also regulates the growth and development of trophoblasts or embryonic stem cells. </p>
<p>IL6 and IL3 synergise in vitro in promoting the proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL6 is also a thrombopoietin that induces the maturation of megakaryocytes in vitro and increases platelet counts in vivo. In murine, but not in human bone marrow cultures (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture) IL6 shows activities resembling those of GM-CSF. </p>
<p>Plasmacytoma cells produce IL6 and also the IL6 receptor. It has been suggested that these cells are stimulated in an autocrine fashion. A paracrine mechanism involving the presence of two different cell populations, one producing the factor and the other expressing the receptor, has been described also. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL6 have been evaluated in transgenic mice expressing the human IL6 gene. These animals display dramatically elevated serum levels of IL6 and polyclonal IgG1. In addition one observes a massive plasmacytosis and all typical indications of a proliferative mesangial glomerulonephritis, which is probably due to the excessive overproduction of the cytokine. </p>
<p>Transgenic mice expressing the IL6 gene under the control of the human keratin gene promoter express IL6 in squamous epithelial cells. These mice are much smaller than normal mice and they also show a retarded development of the coat. An increased proliferation of epidermal cells and an infiltration of leukocytes are not observed. Other transgenic mice constitutively expressing murine IL6 at a level sufficient to induce IL6-responsive genes show less immature B-cells in bone marrow and expression of IL6-inducible liver genes, but the mice appear healthy and can easily be used for breeding. A high incidence of lymphomas associated with different tissues is observed only in mice older than 18 months. </p>
<p>Intracerebral overexpression of IL6 in transgenic mice has been shown to be associated with neurological syndromes the severity of which correlate with the levels of IL6 expression. These mice are characterized by runting, tremor, neurodegeneration, astrocytosis, angiogenesis, and induction of acute phase proteins production, suggesting a direct pathogenic role of IL6 in inflammatory, infectious, and neurodegenerative CNS diseases. </p>
<p>Brett et al (1995) have used a transgenic mouse model to express IL6 in brain astrocytes. They demonstrate an extensive break down of the blood brain barrier. Depending upon expression levels and age the animals show a leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrate, vacuolated astrocytic foot processes and endothelial abnormalities, parenchymal inflammation, gliosis, spongiform change, axonal degeneration and macrophage accumulation. </p>
<p>Kitamura et al (1995) have produced transgenic mice expressing human IL6. The animals showed histologically evident neutrophilia in the bone marrow. A Colony formation assay of bone marrow cells for CFU-C revealed increases in precursors of granulocytes and monocytes (see also: hematopoiesis). A decrease in osteoblast precursor cells was observed in 15 week old mice. Osteoclast numbers and bone resorption were also decreased. </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL6 have been studied also in IL6 deficient mice generated by targeted disruption of the IL6 gene in embryonic stem cells (see: ES cells). IL6 deficient mice of both sexes are viable and fertile and do not present any evident phenotypic abnormality. However, analysis of bone metabolism in females demonstrates that these animals have higher rates of bone turnover than control litter mates. In these mice, ovariectomy, which is known to result in increased bone turnover with bone resorption exceeding bone formation in normal animals, does not induce any change in either bone mass or bone remodeling rates. These results suggest that IL6 plays an important role in the local regulation of bone turnover and appears to be essential for bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an IL6 gene disruption have been studied in mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IL6 gene develop normally. The development of bone marrow and spleen B-cells in IL6 deficient mice appears to be normal. Numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T-cells are consistently reduced by 20-40 % as compared to controls, suggesting that IL6 is involved in T-cell proliferation. Thymocytes and T-cells show a normal expression pattern of T-cell receptor alpha, beta, gamma, and delta chains, CD4, CD8, and some other markers. </p>
<p>IL6 deficient mice fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The T-cell dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. IL6 deficient mice also show gross abnormalities with respect to the acute phase reaction in response to tissue damage or infection (see also: inflammation, wound healing). This response, however, is only moderately affected after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL6 can be detected in bioassays employing IL6 responsive cell lines (see: 7TD1; B9; CESS, KPMM2, KT-3; M1, MH60-BSF-2, MO7E; Mono Mac 6; NFS-60; PIL-6; SKW6-Cl4; T1165; XG-1). IL6 can be assayed also by its activity as a hybridoma growth factor (see: HGF). </p>
<p>Sensitive immunoassays and colorimetric tests are also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. An ELISA assay exists for detecting the receptor-associated gp130 protein. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The determination of IL6 serum levels may be useful to monitor the activity of myelomas and to calculate tumor cell masses. Low IL6 serum levels are observed in monoclonal gammopathies and in smouldering myelomas while IL6 serum levels are markedly increased in patients with progressive disease and also in patients with plasma cell leukemia. A blockade of the IL6 receptor or the inhibition of IL6 by monoclonal antibodies may be a way to delay or prevent the maturation of B-cells into plasma cells, suggesting also a new therapeutical concept involving cytostatic drugs coupled to monoclonal antibodies. </p>
<p>The deregulated expression of IL6 is probably one of the major factor involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. The excessive overproduction of IL6 (and other B-cell differentiation factors; see also: BCDF) has been observed in various pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, Lennert syndrome (histiocytic lymphoma), Castleman's disease (lymphadenopathy with massive infiltration of plasma cells, hyper gamma-globulinemia, anemia, and enhanced concentrations of acute phase proteins), cardiac myxomas and liver cirrhosis. The constitutive synthesis of IL6 by glioblastomas and the secretion of IL6 into the cerebrospinal fluid may explain the elevated levels of acute phase proteins and immune complexes in the serum. </p>
<p>IL6 probably also plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic polyarthritis (together with IL1 and IL8) since excessive concentrations of IL6 are found in the synovial fluid. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that IL6, due to its effects on hematopoietic cells, may be suitable for the treatment of certain types of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Pretreatment with IL3 and subsequent administration of IL6 has been shown to increase platelet counts considerable. A combination of these two factors could therefore be valuable for the effective control of thromocytopenias and the very severe complications (excessive bleeding) usually associated with this condition. In combination with other cytokines (for example, IL2) IL6 may be useful in the treatment of some tumor types. </p>
<p>Very high levels of IL6 in the cerebrospinal fluid are observed frequently in bacterial (up to 500 ng/mL) and viral meningitis (10 - 1000 ng/mL). The detection of elevated concentrations of IL6 in the urine of transplanted patients may be an early indicator of a graft-versus-host reaction. The detection of IL6 in the amniotic fluid may be an indication of intra-amniotic infections. In inflammatory intestinal diseases elevated plasma levels of IL6 may be an indicator of disease status. In patients with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis elevated urine levels of IL6 are also an indicator of disease status. </p>
<p>Monitoring of postoperative serum IL6 levels may be more helpful than monitoring of C-reactive protein levels for estimation of inflammatory status and early detection of an acute phase reaction. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL6 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts. Altered tumor cells expressing IL4 also increase systemic immunity. Mice vaccinated with transduced cells reject a subsequent challenge of non-transduced cells, and, in some cases, a pre-existing tumor (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>Serum and urinary IL6 levels have been shown to be predicting factors of Kawasaki disease activity. </p>

<h2>IL8</h2>
<p>Interleukin-8. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>

See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL8 is produced by stimulated monocytes but not by tissue macrophages and T-lymphocytes. IL8 is produced also by macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, and a number of tumor cell lines. </p>
<p>In many cell types the synthesis of IL8 is strongly stimulated by IL1 and TNF-alpha. In human skin fibroblasts the expression of IL8 is enhanced by Leukoregulin. The interferon IFN-gamma can function as a costimulator. The synthesis of IL8 is induced also by phytohemagglutinins, concanavalin A, double-stranded RNA, Phorbol esters, sodium urate crystals, viruses, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The expression of IL8 from resting and stimulated human blood monocytes is upregulated by IL7. In chondrocytes the synthesis of IL8 is stimulated by IL1-beta (see: IL1), TNF-alpha and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. In human astrocytes the synthesis and secretion of IL8 is induced by IL1 and TNF-alpha. Glucocorticoids, IL4, TGF-beta, inhibitors of 5' lipoxygenase, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 inhibit the synthesis of IL8. IL8 is constitutively and commonly produced by various carcinoma cell lines and this synthesis may be related to the elevation of serum IL8 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of IL8 is induced by IL17. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL8 is a non-glycosylated protein of 8 kDa (72 amino acids). It is produced by processing of a precursor protein of 99 amino acids. Processing of this precursor by specific proteases yields N-terminal variants of IL8. One of the enzymes converting the 77 amino acid form to the 72 amino acid form has been identified as cathepsin L (see: IL8 converting enzyme). </p>
<p>AVLPR-IL8 is a truncated IL8 variant lacking the first five amino acids. This shortened protein is identical with FDNCF (fibroblast-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor). </p>
<p>Longer forms of IL8 (79 and 77 amino acids) and shorter forms (69 amino acids) have been isolated also from conditioned medium of lymphocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (see: MDNCF, monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factors and FINAP, Fibroblast-derived neutrophil-activating protein), Fibroblasts stimulated by IL1 or TNF (see: NAP-1, neutrophil-activating protein), and polyI: C-stimulated endothelial cells (see: LAI, leukocyte adhesion inhibitor). The predominant form of IL8 produced by endothelial cells (and also by anchorage-dependent cells and human glioblastoma cells) is the 77 amino acid variant. For an endothelial cell-derived IL8 variant ([(Ala)-IL8](77)) serving as an apoptosis inducing factor see also: HL-60 cell line. </p>
<p>The IL8 protein contains four cysteine residues participating in disulfide bridges (Cys-7/Cys-34; Cys-9/Cys-50). </p>
<p>A Leu25Tyr mutation of IL8, which introduces the conserved tyrosine residue present in CC-Chemokines has been shown to create a factor that bestows upon IL8 the property to act as a chemoattractant for monocytes and the ability to bind to the CCR1 chemokine receptor. A Leu25Cys mutation of IL8 introduces chemoattractant activity for monocytes and the ability to displace MIP-1-alpha from the CCR1 receptor. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL8 gene (SCYB8) has a length of 5.1 kb and contains four exons. It maps to human chromosome 4q12-q21. The mRNA consists of a 101 base 5' untranslated region, an open reading frame of 297 bases, and a long 3' untranslated region of 1.2 kb. The 5' flanking region of the IL8 gene contains potential binding sites for several nuclear factors including activation factor-1, activation factor-2, IFN regulatory factor-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, a glucocorticoid responsive element, and a heat shock element. </p>
<p> RELATED FACTORS </p>
<p>The proteins mig (monokine induced by gamma-Interferon) (see also: Monokines), PF4 (platelet factor-4), MGSA (melanoma growth stimulatory activity), and a number of several other factors belonging to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines are related to IL8. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL8 receptor is a dimeric glycoprotein consisting of a 59 kDa and a 67 kDa subunit. It has been given the name CD128. It is expressed in many different cell types including those not responding to IL8. The receptor density is approximately 20000/cell in neutrophils and approximately 300/cell in T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>The IL8 receptor is a member of a G-protein-coupled receptor protein family (see also: GPR9). There are at least two different IL8 receptor types. The type 1 receptor specifically binds IL8 (Kd = 0.8-4 nM). The type 2 receptor (Kd for IL8 = 0.3-2 nM) also binds the IL8-related factors MGSA (Melanoma growth stimulatory activity), GRO (see: MGSA), MIP-2 (see: MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein), and NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2). Both receptor genes map to human chromosome 2q35. For a protein highly homologous to the IL8 receptors see: EBI-1 (EBV induced gene-1) and ECRF-3. The MGSA/GRO/IL8/MIP receptor has been identified as CKR1, which is identical with the Duffy blood group antigen that appears to be a receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. </p>
<p>orf74 encoded by the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus KSHV has been shown to encode a protein with significant sequence homology to the high-affinity IL8 receptor (see also: Viroceptor). IL8 has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The activities of IL8 are not species-specific. Human IL8 is also active in rodent and rabbit cells. The biological activities of IL8 resemble those of a related protein, NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2). </p>
<p>IL8 differs from all other cytokines in its ability to specifically activate neutrophil granulocytes. In neutrophils IL8 causes a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels (see also: Calcium ionophore) and the release of enzymes from granules. IL8 also enhances the metabolism of reactive oxygen species and increases Chemotaxis and the enhanced expression of adhesion molecules. A pre-activation by IL3 is required to render basophils and neutrophils susceptible to further activation by IL8. IL8 alone does not release histamines. IL8 actually inhibits histamine release from human basophils induced by histamine releasing factors (see also: HRF), CTAP-3 (connective tissue activating protein-3), and IL3. IL8 is involved also in mediating pain. </p>
<p>IL8 antagonizes IgE production by human B-cells without induced by IL4, affecting IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, or IgA production. IL8 directly affects B-cells through a specific mechanism that is different from IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, or prostaglandin E2 </p>
<p>The intravenous administration of IL8 in baboons causes a severe, albeit transient, granulocytopenia, followed by a granulocytosis, which persists as long as sufficient IL8 levels are maintained. </p>
<p>IL8 is chemotactic for all known types of migratory immune cells (see also: Chemotaxis). IL8 inhibits the adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells (see also: cell activation) and therefore possesses anti-inflammatory activities (see also: LAI, leukocyte adhesion inhibitor). The 72 amino acid form of IL8 is approximately ten-fold more potent in inhibiting adhesion of neutrophils than the 77 amino acid variant. IL8 is a mitogen for epidermal cells. In vivo IL8 strongly binds to erythrocytes. This absorption may be of physiological importance in the regulation of inflammatory reactions since IL8 bound to erythrocytes no longer activates neutrophils. Macrophage-derived IL8 supports angiogenesis and may play a role in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumor growth, and wound healing that critically depend on angiogenesis. </p>
<p>Binding of IL8 to its receptor and bioactivities of IL8 are inhibited by a synthetic peptide, antileukinate. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Blockade of IL8 expression in some human melanoma cell lines by antisense RNA has shown that IL8 functions as an autocrine growth modulator for these cells. A participation of IL8 in macrophage mediated angiogenesis is suggested by the observation that IL8 antisense RNA blocks angiogenic activity induced by monocytes. </p>
<p>Simonet et al (1994) have studied transgenic mice overexpressing IL8. Elevated serum IL8 levels were found to correlate with increases in circulating neutrophils and decreases in L-selectin expression on the surface of blood neutrophils. Changes in the expression of the integrin-beta-2 integrins Mac-1 (CD11b) and LFA-1 (CD11a) on peripheral blood neutrophilswere not observed. Expression of L-selectin on bone marrow neutrophils and their precursors was normal. The accumulation of neutrophils was observed in the microcirculation of the lung, liver and spleen. Neutrophil extravasation, plasma exudation or tissue damage were absent. Migration of neutrophils into the inflamed peritoneal cavity was severely inhibited. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL8 can be detected in assays measuring the migration of buffy coat leukocytes from agarose blocks. Sensitive immunoassays are also available. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL8 may be of clinical relevance in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated concentrations are observed in psoriatic scales and this may explain the high proliferation rate observed in these cells. IL8 may be also a marker of different inflammatory processes. </p>
<p>IL8 (and also IL1 and IL6) probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic polyarthritis since excessive amounts of this factor are found in synovial fluids. The activation of neutrophils may enhance the migration of cells into the capillaries of the joints. These cells are thought to pass through the capillaries and enter the surrounding tissues thus causing a constant stream of inflammatory cells through the joints. </p>
<p>Human recombinant IL8 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) has been shown that the lesion responsible for defective functions of neutrophils in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome can be restored without stimulating myeloid progenitor cells. IL8 may be able, therefore, to reduce the risks of lethal infections in these patients without the potential risk of stimulating leukemic clones. </p>

<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-4-) migration inhibition factor, migration inhibitory factor, macrophage inhibition factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MMIF) </p>
<p>An operational definition for factors that inhibit in vitro the migration of macrophages out of capillary tubes or small pieces of tissue (see also: Motogenic cytokines). Many proteins have been described to possess MIF activity, including TNF, IFN-gamma, IL1, IL2, GM-CSF (see also: LIF (leukocyte migration inhibitory factor). The proteins known as MRP-8 and MRP-14 (MIF-related protein) are MIF-related proteins that are recognized by some monoclonal antibodies directed against MIF activities. They are related to Calgranulins. </p>
<p>Another protein, called MIF-1, with MIF activity is secreted by a T-cell hybridoma. Another biochemically uncharacterized migration inhibitory factor is F5MIF-2. Another factor influencing the chemotactic behavior of neutrophilic macrophages (see also: Chemotaxis) is HDLF (Hodgkin-derived leukocyte factor). In addition there are many other biochemically uncharacterized factors with MIF activity that cannot be blocked by antibodies against known cytokines and that are therefore probably distinct factors. </p>
<p>MMIF has been cloned and has been shown to be a major secreted protein released by anterior pituitary cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. It is identical with Sarcolectin binding protein. Pituitary-derived MIF contributes to circulating MIF present in the post-acute phase of endotoxinemia (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome). Recombinant murine MIF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) greatly enhances lethality when co-injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharides and anti-MIF antibodies confer protection against lethal endotoxinemia. One particular factor with MIF activity is found also in chicken murine and human embryonic eye lenses (see: 10K protein). The human gene for this factor has been mapped by Budarf et al (1997) to chromosome 22q11.2. </p>
<p>A 12 kDa factor of 115 amino acids that also inhibits the migration of macrophages is produced by antigen-stimulated T-cells. These proteins show extensive sequence homology with each other and with a rat liver protein, designated TRANSMIF, a murine protein designated GIF (glycosylation inhibiting factor), and a mouse delayed-early response gene, designated DER6 [delayed early response gene 6]. These highly homologous proteins, sharing sequence homologies of up to 98 %, are structurally related to the theta-class of Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), a subclass of GSTs thought to be the most ancient evolutionary GST class. All proteins have retained a glutathione binding domain and demonstrate transferase activity. GSTs protect against xenobiotic chemicals by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione, which renders them non-toxic. Mouse, human and chicken macrophage migration inhibitory factor has been found to be highly homologous to rat liver 13k protein. </p>
<p> The receptor for MIF has been shown to be CD74 (Leng et al, 2003). The receptor complex uses CD44 as a signaling coreceptor (Shi et al, 2006). </p>
<p> MIF is known as a mediator of cellular immunity with specific effects on the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. The expression of MIF activity correlates well with delayed hypersensitivity and cellular immunity in humans and MIF is now recognized as a principal cytokine modulating T-cell / macrophage interactions in the expression of delayed hypersensitivity and acquired cellular immunity. Recombinant human MIF is responsible for the specific activation of macrophages to kill intracellular parasites such as Mycobacterium avium and Leishmania donovani. </p>
<p>Recombinant human MIF has been shown to activate macrophage expression of NO, a potent antimicrobial agent that is produced by the NO synthase mediated oxidation of terminal L-arginine guanidine nitrogen atoms. </p>
<p>Recombinant human MIF upregulates expression of genes encoding HLA-DR and IL1-beta (see: IL1) and elaboration of IL1-beta by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human recombinant MIF can also activate cultured human peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to become cytotoxic for tumor cells in vitro. MIF also induces macrophages to produce TNF-alpha and IL1-beta (see: IL1). MIF also stimulates nitric oxide production by macrophages primed with IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Administration of soluble bovine serum albumin or human immunodeficiency virus 120 kDa glycoprotein to mice in the presence of recombinant MIF together with incomplete Freund's adjuvant induces a strong T-cell proliferative response comparable to that of complete Freund's adjuvant. Recombinant MIF also increases antibody production, especially of IgG1 and IgM, in mice. MIF may be useful, therefore, as an adjuvant in the development of vaccines. </p>
<p>MIF activity can be detected in the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The expression of MIF at sites of inflammation also suggests a role for the mediator in regulating the function of macrophages in host defense. </p>
<p>For a homolog of MIF encoded by a parasite see also: Bm-MIF. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Takahashi et al (1998) have investigated the expression of MIF in a colon cancer cell line (colon 26 cells) and its correlation with cell proliferation. Sublines from tumors obtained by serial transplantation in mice showed a significantly higher in vitro cell proliferation rate than the parent cell line and also showed higher levels of expression of MIF protein and mRNA. Transfection of antisense RNA against MIF into the parent cell line suppressed cell growth significantly. The authors point out that MIF may work as a growth factor for tumor cell growth and may be involved in the mechanism of metastasis. </p>

<p> Copyright © 2012 by H IBELGAUFTS. All rights reserved. ENTRY COMPLETED.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>PDGF</h2>
<p>[platelet-derived growth factor] </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>FDGF (fibroblast-derived growth factor); GDGF (glioma-derived growth factor); GDGF-1 (glioma-derived growth factor = PDGF-AA homodimer); GDGF-2 (glioma-derived growth factor = PDGF-AB heterodimer); GSM (Glucocorticoid-suppressible mitogenic activity = PDGF-AA homodimer); MDF (mesangial cell proliferating factor); MDGF (monocyte-derived growth factor); OBIF [osteoblastogenesis inhibitory factor] (= PDGF-BB) ODGF (osteosarcoma-derived growth factor); T47D factor. PDGF is the major component of MDF and MDGF. Some of the MDGF activity may be due to fibroblast growth factors (see: FGF). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>PDGF is synthesized mainly by megakaryocytes. It is stored in the alpha granules of platelets from which it is released after cell activation of platelets for example by thrombin. </p>
<p>A plethora of other cell types also synthesize PDGF including macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, glial cells, astrocytes, myoblasts, smooth muscle cells, and a number of tumor cell lines. In vivo PDGF is synthesized by man cells as a protein consisting of one of the two PDGF chains. Platelets synthesize a mixture of the three possible isoforms (70 % AB, 20 % BB, 10 % AA) while fibroblasts stimulated with EGF synthesize AA homodimers. Activated macrophages and placental cytotrophoblasts produce the BB homodimer. </p>
<p>The synthesis of PDGF can be induced by IL1, IL6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and EGF. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>PDGF is a heat-stable positively charged (pI = 9.8-10) hydrophilic protein of 30 kDa. It consists of two related peptide chains, PDGF-A or PDGF-1 (16 kDa, 124 amino acids), and PDGF-B or PDGF-2 (14 kDa, 140 amino acids) that contain intramolecular disulfide bonds. The subunits are linked by disulfide bonds. All possible isoforms, i.e., PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AB are biologically active. </p>
<p>Several variant forms of PDGF-A have been described. They display approximately 60 % homology with PDGF-B. PDGF-B is identical with the gene product of the cellular oncogene sis. The aminoterminal end of PDGF-B is almost identical with p28sis, the transforming oncoprotein of simian sarcoma virus (see: sis). </p>
<p>The three isoforms of PDGF bind to PDGF with different affinities and also differ in their biological activities. </p>
<p>Mutant forms of PDGF have been created. They form wild-type/mutant heterodimers deficient in assembly or processing. Such mutants behave as dominant negative mutants and are useful in investigation of the role of PDGF in normal and pathological conditions. </p>
<p>PDGF-BB, TGF-beta-2 (see: TGF-beta), and NGF share a similar overall topology (see also: Cystine knot growth factor family). </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding PDGF-A has a length of approximately 24 kb and contains at least seven exons. It maps to human chromosome 7p21-p22. The PDGF-A variants arise by differential splicing of the mRNA. </p>
<p>The PDGF-B gene has a length of approximately 24 kb and contains at least seven exons. It maps to human chromosome 22q12.3-q13. 1 in the vicinity of the gene encoding PD-ECGF (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor) at 22q13. </p>
<p>The PDGF genes are evolutionary conserved from mammals to amphibians. Both genes display a similar exon-intron structures and contain long (>  1 kb) 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The activity of both genes is regulated independently of each other in some cell types and co-ordinately in some other cell types. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>PDGF can signal through two related receptors (Claesson-Welsh L et al, 1991), which can form homodimeric and heterodimeric receptor complexes (Heldin CH et al, 1992). Some of the signal transduction processes mediated by PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta are unique and some are also common (Eriksson A et al, 1992).  </p>
<p>The symbol PDGFR [PDGF receptor] has been replaced by PDGFR1 [PDGF receptor-1]. The approved gene symbol for this receptor is PDGFRB [PDGFR-beta; PDGF receptor-beta]. In the nomenclature of CD antigens the receptor is being referred to as CD140b. For a protein with significant sequence similarity to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of PDGFRB see: PRLTS (PDGF-receptor beta-like tumor suppressor). </p>
<p>The cDNA encoding PDGFR1 has been cloned by Gronwald et al (1988). They have shown that PDGFR1 acts as a high affinity receptor specific for the PDGF-BB isoform of PDGF. Claesson-Welsh et al (1988) have shown that this receptor specifically binds the B-chain-containing PDGF molecules.  </p>
<p>A second receptor has been designated PDGFR2 [PDGF receptor-2]. The approved gene symbol is PDGFRA [PDGFR-alpha; PDGF receptor-alpha]. This receptor binds PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB (Matsui et al, 1989). The genomic structure of the PDGFRA gene has been described by Kawagishi et al (1995). In the nomenclature of CD antigens this receptor has been given the designation CD140a. For a naturally occurring mutant of PDGFRA see: Patch.  </p>
<p>Truncated receptor forms that contain only the extracellular domain have been described also. They are secreted and behave as antagonists of PDGF-stimulated processes (Duan et al, 1991). A PDGF-B-derived peptide comprising the sequences between positions 116-121 and 157-163 (ANFLVWEIVRKK) functions as a PDGF antagonist. It competes with PDGF for binding to the alpha and beta receptors and inhibits the dimerisation and autophosphorylation of the receptor (Engstrm U et al, 1992). For a designer binding protein affecting PDGF binding to its receptor see: GFB-111. </p>
<p>The gene encoding PDGFRB maps to human chromosome 5q33.3, flanked proximally by the GM-CSF gene and only 500 bp away from the fms oncogene that functions as a receptor for M-CSF (see also: 5q minus syndrome) (Eccles et al, 1991). The gene encoding PDGFRA maps to human chromosome 4q11-q12 in the same region (approximately 700 kb) as the kit oncogene that is the receptor for SCF (stem cell factor) (Stenman et al, 1989; Roberts et al, 1988; Gronwald et al, 1990; Hsieh C et al, 1991).  </p>
<p>Di Pasquale et al (2003) have shown that both PDGF receptors act as receptors adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV-5).  </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>In contrast to many other cytokines PDGF is not released into the circulation. The biological half-life is less than two minutes after intravenous administration. </p>
<p>PDGF binds to several plasma proteins and also to proteins of the extracellular matrix which facilitates local concentration of the factor. The factor functions as a local autocrine and paracrine growth factor. In the adult organism PDGF is involved in wound healing processes. The aberrant expression of PDGF is observed with vascular proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis. PDGF and PDGF-like factors are autocrine growth factor for meningiomas. </p>
<p>The induction of various forms of PDGF by TNF-beta is responsible for its inhibitory activities on proliferation. At concentrations of 1-2 fg/cell TGF-beta is a growth inhibitor for smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and chondrocytes while higher concentrations promote proliferation. This bimodal activity is mediated by PDGF-AA the synthesis and secretion of which is stimulated by low concentrations of TGF-beta while higher concentrations of TGF-beta downregulate the expression of the PDGF receptor and hence the biological activities of PDGF. </p>
<p>PDGF-AA, in contrast to PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB, is a poor mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. However, together with bFGF, which upregulates PDGF-alpha receptors, it acts synergistically on DNA synthesis of these cells. PDGF does not act on epithelial cells and endothelial cells because these cell types do not express PDGF receptors. It has been shown that PDGF-BB is a potent mediator of connective tissue stroma formation in xenotransplanted human melanoma cells genetically engineered to secrete PDGF-BB, thereby facilitating the formation of a functional vascular system in the tumor (see also: Angiogenesis). </p>
<p>PDGF regulates the synthesis of its own receptor and also influences the expression of membrane receptors for IL1, EGF, 5-Hydroxytryptamine, LDL, transferrin, and muscarinergic receptors (see also: Receptor transmodulation). PDGF induces the expression of many new genes in a plethora of cell types. Many of these genes also function as cytokines (see: Chemokines). </p>
<p>The functional consequences of the heterogeneity of PDGF are largely unknown. The dimeric form of PDGF is mainly mitogenic for cells of mesenchymal origin while monomeric forms of PDGF are mainly chemotactic (see also: Chemotaxis). Depending upon the cell type, the various isoforms of PDGF may stimulate or inhibit chemotactic responses. </p>
<p>PDGF supports the proliferation and mobility of oligodendrocytes/type 1 astrocytes and inhibits the premature differentiation of their progenitor cells. The neurotrophic and neuroregulatory activities (see also: Neurotrophins) of PDGF are demonstrated also by the fact that PDGF is involved in the development of the nervous system since PDGF-B receptors are expressed in almost all areas of the central nervous system. </p>
<p>At low concentrations PDGF is a chemoattractant for fibroblasts (see also: Chemotaxis). PDGF is also chemotactic and activating for monocytes and neutrophils. (see also: cell activation) and activates the arachidonic acid cascade in these cells. PDGF is also a potent modulator of T-cell functions. PDGF is also a potent chemoattractant for several hematopoietic cell types (see also: hematopoiesis) and cells of mesenchymal origin. PDGF is a potent vasoconstrictor. </p>
<p>PDGF-A and the alpha receptor are expressed selectively and transiently in early embryonic development of vertebrates and also in embryonic carcinoma cells. The analysis of the murine dominant Patch (Ph) mutation has revealed that deletions of the alpha receptor causes severe anatomical alterations. These mutations are lethal. It can therefore be assumed that the function of PDGF during embryonic development is different from those in adult organisms. </p>
<p>The mitogenic activities of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB are modulated by binding of PAP [PDGF-associated protein]. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>A transgenic model in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was placed under transcriptional control of the PDGF B-chain promoter demonstrates that the transgene is expressed preferentially within neural cell bodies in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. PDGF may act as a neuronal regulatory agent with neuronal release of PDGF contributing to nerve regeneration and to glial proliferation that leads to gliosis and scarring. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>PDGF can be assayed by means of a competitive enzymoimmunoassay or a radioreceptor assay or in assays using 3T3 fibroblasts. Fredriksson et al (2002) have described a technique in which the simultaneous binding of two DNA aptamer probes directed against PDGF allows detection of zeptomole (40 x 10**-21 mol) amounts of PDGF without washes or separations. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>Some initial studies suggest that PDGF (alone and in combination) may be useful in promoting bone formation and in soft tissue repair. Local application of recombinant PDGF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) to bed ulcers has been shown to shorten the time required for healing. </p>
<p>PDGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibroproliferative disorders and is closely associated with the presence of established disease. Markedly elevated levels of PDGF have been observed in obliterative bronchiolitis, a frequently fatal fibroproliferative disorder leading to the occlusion of small airways and affecting up to 30 % of lung transplant recipients. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that autocrine loops established by co-expression of PDGF and its receptor may contribute to the growth of malignant astrocytomas in humans. </p>

<h2>Stem%20cell%20factor</h2>
<p>abbr. usually SCF. </p>
<p>Note: the abbreviation SCF has been used also for Sertoli cell factor. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>HLGF-1 (hemolymphopoietic growth factor-1); KL (kit ligand); MC/9 cell growth-promoting factor (MC/9-GF), see: MC/9; Mast/stem cell growth factor MGF (multipotent growth factor); MGF (mast cell growth factor); SCGF (stem cell growth factor); SLF (steel factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>SCF is a stromal cell-derived cytokine synthesized by fibroblasts and other cell types (see also: BMC (bone marrow culture); Stromal cell line, Hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>SCF is a protein of 164 amino acids (BRL cells, rat) or 248 amino acids (human). The protein is extensively N- and O-glycosylated. Glycosylation is not required for biological activity since the non-glycosylated recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli is biologically fully active (see also: Recombinant cytokines). The domain structure and some of the biochemical properties of SCF resemble those of M-CSF. </p>
<p>The murine protein forms dimers. It displays approximately 80 % sequence homology with the human factor. Proteolytic cleavage of a longer membrane-bound precursor protein of 220 and 248 amino acids, respectively, yields the active murine and human factor. The precursor also possesses biological activity. Differential expression of soluble (designated also or SCF-1) and membrane-bound forms of the factor (designated KL-1, KL-2, or SCF-2) is achieved by alternative splicing of the corresponding mRNAs. The membrane-bound form of SCF can mediate specific cell-to-cell contacts by interaction with receptors on near-by cells (see: juxtacrine). </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding SCF maps to human chromosome 12q22-q24. It has a length of approximately 70 kb and contains 21 exons. </p>
<p>The murine KL gene is identical with the SL (Steel) locus identified by many lethal mutations. It maps to murine chromosome 10. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The receptor for SCF, designated SCFR, is the oncogene designated kit. In the nomenclature of CD antigens it has been given the designation CD117. </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Rat SCF is as active as human SCF with respect to the induction of proliferation of bone marrow stem cells. Human SCF is approximately 800-fold less active on murine cells than rat SCF. Murine SCF is active on human cells and can be employed in long-term BMC (bone marrow culture). </p>
<p>Mutated alleles of SCF with deletions in the coding region and also mutations in the receptor gene (see: kit) are lethal and cause the early death of homozygous embryos in mice. These animals display a pronounced anemia and severe impairment of development of the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis) characterized by a very pronounced deficiency of mast cells. The anemia and mast cells deficiency observed in animals with mutations in the Sl gene can be abolished by administration of SCF. </p>
<p>In vitro SCF is a growth factor for primitive lymphoid and myeloid hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells expressing the early cell surface marker CD34 or murine Sca-1 (see also: hematopoiesis); see also: BFU-E (burst-forming unit erythroid). The action of SCF on mouse and human hematopoietic progenitors is inhibited by TGF-beta. </p>
<p>To date it is unclear whether SCF really is the stem cell factor because there are some indications that cells exist which are even more primitive than those responding to SCF and other factors with SCF activity have been reported (see: SCPF, stem cell proliferation factor). At least SCF appears to be one factor that is responsible for the maintenance of basal constitutive and steady-state Hematopoiesis </p>
<p>The biological activities of SCF are synergised considerably by colony stimulating factors GM-CSF and G-CSF, and also by IL7, Epo and some other growth and differentiation factors. </p>
<p>In combination with IL7 SCF stimulates the proliferation of pre-B-cells. The combination of SCF and IL7 does not stimulate the expansion or differentiation of B220(-) (= CD45(-)) lymphoid precursors but can act synergistically in the clonal proliferation of B220(+) cells. In combination with Epo SCF stimulates the proliferation of early erythroid cells (see: BFU-E), and in combination with G-CSF SCF stimulates the proliferation of granulocytes. </p>
<p>In vivo administration of SCF significantly raises the numbers of megakaryocytes and circulating platelet counts. SCF may be an important regulator of platelet production under both normal and physiologically disturbed situations. </p>
<p>The subcutaneous administration of recombinant human SCF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) to baboons (Papio cynocephalus) or cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) leads to a pronounced expansion of populations of mast cells in many anatomical sites, with numbers of mast cells in some organs by more than 100-fold. There is no clinical evidence of cell activation of mast cells, and discontinuation of treatment with SCF results in a rapid decline of numbers of mast cells nearly to baseline levels. </p>
<p>SCF is also a potent chemoattractant for cells (see also: Chemotaxis), for example, mast cells, expressing the kit receptor. One response to SCF in these cells is a characteristic rearrangement of the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. At concentrations approximately 10-100 fold lower than those eliciting cell proliferation SCF induces the synthesis of histamines and leukotriene C4 in mast cells. It has been shown that IL3 dependent mast cells (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) undergo apoptosis on removal of IL3 and that this can be prevented by the addition of SCF, thus demonstrating how these principle mast cell growth factors may act in concert to regulate numbers of mast cells under physiologic conditions. </p>
<p>Some human solid tumor cell lines display high-affinity c-kit receptors and produce SCF, suggesting the possibility that autocrine production of SCF by c-kit receptor-bearing tumor cells may enhance cell growth in tumor cell lines. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>A transgene encoding the SV40 large T antigen that is expressed specifically in a subset of thymic epithelial cells around birth causes an increase in the number of immortal thymic epithelial cells, increases thymic mass, and expands thymopoiesis. One of the immortalized cell lines derived from thymic epithelium expresses, among other things, SCF, the genes for major histocompatibility complex class 1 and class 2, Thy1, IL6, IL7, M-CSF, IL4 receptors, and TGF-beta. The expression of SCF is independent of IL4 and is enhanced dramatically in response to IL4. Since SCF, in concert with commitment factors, channels progenitors into hemopoietic lineages (see also: hematopoiesis), these experiments reveal a specific interaction between thymocytes and a specialized subset of thymic epithelial cells. </p>
<p>Transgenic mouse lines carrying the mouse metallothionein/ret fusion gene develop severe melanosis and melanocytic tumors. Crosses of these mice with mice carrying mutants in the SCF receptor demonstrate that the introduction of a functional ret oncogene can compensate for the defect of c-kit during both embryogenesis and postnatal life. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>SCF can be assayed by its growth-promoting activity on pre-B-cells in Whitlock-Witte long-term bone marrow cultures. It can be assayed also in bioassays employing cell lines that respond to the factor (see: MH11; MO7E). An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>SCF is of clinical significance because of its ability to induce differentiation in lymphoid and erythroid progenitor cells and mast cells. Since this factor acts on very immature hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis) its use in combination with other cytokines might be of considerable interest in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and after bone marrow transplantation. Improved in vitro erythropoiesis with SCF has been demonstrated to occur in several types of inherited marrow failure syndromes, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Fanconi's anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood. </p>
<p>In vivo administration of recombinant SCF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) has been shown to lead to an expansion of human marrow hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. Some data suggest that the combination of SCF and IL11 may be useful in humans undergoing myeloablative therapies. Treatment with SCF stimulates the circulation of cells that engraft and rescue lethally irradiated baboons. </p>

<h2>TNFSF10</h2>
<p>[TNF ligand superfamily member 10] This designation is based on homology with other members of the TNF ligand superfamily of proteins.

<h2>TRAIL</h2>
<p>[TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand] The sequence of TRAIL (281 amino acids) was identified in a human heart atrium cDNA library and a murine cDNA library prepared from the 7B9 T-helper cell line. Both cDNAs encode a type 2 membrane protein (N-terminus inside). The gene maps to human chromosome 3q36. TRAIL is called also APO-2 ligand (abbr. APO-2L). The gene encoding this ligand has been described also as TL2 (TNF-like-2) (Tan et al, 1997). Based upon homology with other members of the TNF ligand protein superfamily the protein is referred to also as TNF ligand superfamily member 10 [TNFSF10]. </p>
<p>Membrane bound and soluble forms of TRAIL induce DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in Jurkat and U937 cells and some other lines of hematopoietic origin (see also: hematopoiesis). In humans TRAIL is expressed in a wide spectrum of tissues, including spleen, thymus, prostate, lung, kidney, and intestine. TRAIL-beta and TRAIL-gamma are alternative truncated splice variants of TRAIL that are expressed in neoplastic and normal tissues. TRAIL-beta lacks exon 3 of the TRAIL gene. TRAIL-gamma lacks exons 2 and 3. Both splice variants have lost their pro-apoptotic activity (Krieg et al, 2003). Wang P et al (2011) have identified seven truncated TRAIL variants, (AK, E2, E3, E4, DA, BX424, and BX439). Over-expression of all these TRAIL variants activates NF-kappa-B and its targeting genes in human cells at varying degrees. Some isoforms show NF-kappa-B, IL8, CCL4 and CCL20 promoter activating activity stronger than the wild-type protein. All truncated variant proteins fail to induce apoptosis in cancer cells that are sensitive to TRAIL. Recombinant soluble TRAIL E4 protein also fails to antagonize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. These results suggest that truncated TRAIL variants may play roles in non-apoptotic cellular processes.  </p>
<p>TRAIL appears to represent a marker of differentiation or activation of natural killer cells with phenotypically immature cells mediating TRAIL-dependent but not FAS ligand- or granule release-dependent cytotoxicity, and mature cells mediating the latter two. </p>
<p>The cytotoxic protein induces cell death by apoptosis of many transformed cell lines but not of normal tissues, even though its death domain-containing receptor, DR4, is expressed on both cell types. APO-2 ligand has been shown to activate apoptosis in T-cell enriched cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by IL2, but not in unstimulated cells. </p>
<p>Studies by Kaplan et al (2000) have suggested that TRAIL contributes to macrophage homeostasis by mediating CD4(+) T-cell killing of antigen-presenting macrophages. </p>
<p>Expression of crmA, a virus-derived specific inhibitor of IL1-beta Convertase and of the cysteine protease CPP32, blocks the induction of apoptosis by APO-2 ligand. TRAIL induced apoptosis is blocked also by expression of XIAP or baculovirus p35 protein. Overexpression of BCL2 or BCLxL delay, but do not inhibit, TRAIL induced apoptosis. (Suliman et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Burns and El-Deiry (2001) have demonstrated that overexpression of FLIP-S and BCLxL are sufficient to convey resistance to TRAIL treatment in previously sensitive cancer cell lines. Expression of FLIP-S and BCLxL also protects cells against apoptosis induced by overexpression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. </p>
<p>One ligand for TRAIL has been identified as TRAIL receptor-1, known also as DR4 [death receptor-4] or APO-2. Due to its homology to other members of the TNF receptor superfamily the receptor is being referred to also as TNFRSF10A [TNF receptor superfamily member 10A]. DR4 is a protein of 468 amino acids and is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. The protein is expressed in most human tissues, including spleen, peripheral blood, leukocytes, small intestine, and thymus. DR4 is expressed also in K562 erythroleukemia cells, MCF7 human breast cancer cells and activated T-cells. Overexpression of DR4 triggers apoptosis and this effect can be blocked by expression of crmA, an inhibitor of Caspases. Suliman et al (2001) have shown that FADD and caspase-8, but not caspase-10, are recruited to the DR4 receptor upon ligation with TRAIL. Apoptosis induction by TRAIL is blocked in ells deficient in either FADD or caspase-8 blocked TRAIL induced apoptosis. </p>
<p>TRAIL induces cell death by apoptosis of many transformed cell lines but not of normal tissues, even though its death domain-containing receptor, DR4, is expressed on both cell types. Resistance of some cell types may be explained by the expression of a decoy receptor designated TRID. </p>
<p>Related receptors, all of which interact with TRAIL are TRAIL receptor-2 (TRICK2), TRAIL receptor-3, and TRAIL receptor-4. Another member of the TRAIL receptor family is TRUNDD. </p>
<p>Liabakk et al (2001) have described the generation of monoclonal antibodies against sTRAIL and the development of an ELISA for the soluble form of TRAIL (see also: cytokine assays). </p>

<h2>VEGF-A</h2>
<p>[Vascular endothelial growth factor A] This is the same as VEGF. The term was introduced following the identification of other factors related to VEGF (VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E). </p>
<p>Numbered designations refer to splice variants of VEGF-A. Numbers refer to the lengths of the corresponding proteins. By convention, the form VEGF-Axxx (or VEGF-xxx) is used for variants that promote angiogenesis. Designations with a suffixed letter 'b' such as VEGF-Axxxb (or VEGF-xxxb) are splice variants that have anti-angiogenic activities (Woolard et al, 2004, 2009; Qiu et al, 2009). Some authors have used a suffixed 'a' (VEGF-Axxxa (or VEGF-xxxa) to denote an angiogenic isoform. Bates et al (2002) have shown that the generation of VEGF-xxxb isoforms involves utilization of two different splice acceptor sites that create two sub-exons, termed exon 8a and exon 8b. The open reading frames of exon 8a and exon 8b both code for six amino acids (exon 8a: Cys-Asp-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg; exon 8b: Ser-Leu-Thr-Arg-Lys-Asp). This alternative splicing, therefore, creates proteins of the same length, but with an alternate C-terminus. The receptor-binding domains are still present in VEGF-165b and, hence it acts as a competitive inhibitor of VEGF-165 that can bind to the receptor but does not stimulate the full tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGFR activated by VEGF165 (Woolard et al, 2004; Cebe Suarez et al, 2006). </p>
<p>It has been shown that this family of VEGF isoforms can form a substantial proportion of the total VEGF (Perrin et al, 2005), ranging from 1 % in placental tissues (Bates et al, 2006) to over 95 % in normal colon tissue (Varey et al, 2008). Therefore, control of angiogenesis may be orchestrated not only by the interplay of diverse and unrelated pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic growth factors and cytokines but may depend critically also on the fine tuning of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic VEGF isoform ratios. </p>
<p>The amino-acid structures of the VEGF-xxxb family are 95-96 % identical to VEGF-xxx. For these reasons, all results from previous studies with VEGF knock-out mice will have to be reinterpreted because silencing of VEGF expression also affects expression of the anti-angiogenic VEGF-xxxb isoforms. The same applies to many earlier studies with VEGF antibodies that did not distinguish between pro-angiogenic VEGF-xxx and anti-angiogenic VEGF-xxxb isoforms. </p>

<h2>VEGF</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> (-1-) viral EGF. See: VGF. </p>
<p> Copyright © 2012 by H IBELGAUFTS. All rights reserved. ENTRY COMPLETED. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) [vascular endothelial growth factor; vasculo-endothelial growth factor] also: VEG/PF (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor) or VEGF-1 [vascular endothelial growth factor-1]. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>GD-VEGF (glioma-derived vascular endothelial growth factor); Mouse sarcoma 180-derived growth factor; VAS (Vasculotropin); Vascular endothelial cell proliferation factor; VPF (vascular permeability factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>VEGF has been isolated from bovine pituitaries. The protein is produced also by murine neuroblastoma cell lines and a plethora of other tumor cells, tumors, and normal cell types, including macrophages, lung epithelial cells, kidney epithelial cells, follicular cell in the pituitary, corpus luteum cells, aortic smooth muscle cells. For snake venom VEGF species see also: svVEGF, VEGF-F, TfsvVEGF, ICPP. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>VEGF is called also VEGF-A, following the identification of several VEGF-related factors (VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E). For a related factor see also: GD-VEGF. A considerably larger form of VEGF has been described as L-VEGF. </p>
<p>VEGF is a homodimeric heavily glycosylated protein of 46-48 kDa (24 kDa subunits). Glycosylation is not required, however, for biological activity. The subunits are linked by disulfide bonds. The human factor occurs in several molecular variants of 111 (VEGF-111), 121 (VEGF-121, VEGF-121b), 145 (VEGF-145, VEGF-145b), 148 (VEGF-148), 162 (VEGF-162), 165 (VEGF-165; VEGF-165b), 183 (VEGF-183, VEGF-183b), 189 (VEGF-189, VEGF-189b), 206 (VEGF-206) amino acids, arising by alternative splicing of the mRNA. By convention, the form VEGF-Axxx (or VEGF-xxx) is used for variants that promote angiogenesis. Designations with a suffixed letter 'b' such as VEGF-Axxxb (or VEGF-xxxb) are splice variants that have anti-angiogenic activities (Woolard et al, 2004) ( for further explanations and nomenclature see: VEGF-A). For a peptide with anti-angiogenic activity derived from VEGF exon 6 see: 6a-P. </p>
<p>The splice forms of VEGF differ in their interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and also vary in their individual bioactivities, depending upon the receptor utilized and individual receptor affinities. </p>
<p>The 165 amino acid form of the factor (VEGF-165) is the most common form in most tissues. The VEGF-121, VEGF-165, and VEGF-189 forms appear to be the more abundant isoforms and are usually produced simultaneously by (Neufeld et al, 1999). Kaposi sarcomas express VEGF-121 and VEGF-165. The 189 amino acid variant of VEGF (VEGF-189) is identical with VPF (vascular permeability factor). </p>
<p>VEGF-121 and VEGF-165 are soluble secreted forms of the factor while VEGF-189 and VEGF-206 are mostly bound to heparin-containing proteoglycans in the cell surface or in the basement membrane (see also: extracellular matrix). The bioavailability of VEGF is regulated probably at the genetic level by alternative splicing that determines whether VEGF will be soluble or incorporated into a biological reservoir and also through proteolysis following plasminogen activation. </p>
<p>Rat and bovine VEGF are one amino acid shorter than the human factor, and the bovine and human sequences show a homology of 95 %. </p>
<p>VEGF is not related with fibroblast growth factors (see: FGF) and only displays limited homology (18 %) to the beta chain of PDGF. However, the positions of all eight cysteine residues are conserved in VEGF and PDGF. </p>
<p>In contrast to other factors mitogenic for endothelial cells such as aFGF, bFGF and PDGF VEGF is synthesized as a precursor containing a typical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 26 amino acids. Glycosylation is not required for efficient secretion of VEGF. </p>
<p>For a VEGF-related factor see also: VRF. </p>
<p>The rat GS-9L glioma cell line has been shown to produce heterodimers composed of VEGF and PlGF subunits in addition of VEGF and PlGF homodimers. </p>
<p>For virus-encoded proteins that may act like VEGF mimics see orf virus (see also: Virokine). </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human gene has a length of approximately 12 kb and contains eight exons. Four species of mRNA encoding VEGF have been identified and found to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. They arise from differential splicing with the 165 amino acid form of VEGF lacking sequences encoded by exon 6 and the 121 amino acid form lacking exon 6 and 7 sequences. The VEGF gene maps to human chromosome 6p12-p21. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>A high-affinity glycoprotein receptor of 170-235 kDa is expressed on vascular endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with heparin-like molecules of the extracellular matrix is required for efficient receptor binding. Protamine sulfate and suramin are capable of replacing the receptor-bound factor. The high-affinity receptor for VEGF, now known as VEGFR1, has been identified as the gene product of the flt-1. Another receptor for VEGF, now known as VEGFR2, is KDR, also known as flk-1. A factor that competes with the 165 amino acid form of VEGF for receptor binding is PlGF (placenta growth factor). A third receptor type, VEGFR3 is known also as flt-4. An isoform-specific receptor for VEGF-165 (VEGF-165R) has been identified as human Neuropilin-1. </p>
<p>The binding of VEGF to Alpha-2-Macroglobulin inhibits its receptor binding ability, indicating that this protein may function as a VEGF removal and inactivation factor. Heparin and heparan sulfate, but not other glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate, efficiently inhibit the binding of VEGF to Alpha-2-Macroglobulin. </p>
<p>For a designer binding protein affecting VEGF binding to its receptor, KDR, see: GFB-111. </p>

<p>The biological activities of VEGF are not species-specific. The different isoforms of VEGF have different properties in vitro and this may apply also to their in vivo functions. </p>
<p>VEGF is a highly specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells. In vitro the two shorter forms of VEGF stimulates the proliferation of macrovascular endothelial cells. VEGF does not appear to enhance the proliferation of other cell types. VEGF significantly influence vascular permeability and is a strong angiogenic protein in several bioassays (see also: Angiogenesis) and probably also plays a role in neovascularisation under physiological conditions. A potent synergism between VEGF and bFGF in the induction of angiogenesis has been observed. It has been suggested that VEGF released from smooth muscle cells and macrophages may play a role in the development of arteriosclerotic diseases. </p>
<p>In endothelial cells VEGF induces the synthesis of von Willebrand factor. It is also a potent chemoattractant for monocytes (see also: Chemotaxis) and thus has procoagulatory activities. In microvascular endothelial cells VEGF induces the synthesis of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. VEGF also induces the synthesis of the metalloproteinase, interstitial collagenase, which degrades interstitial collagen type 1, collagen type 2, and collagen type 3 under normal physiological conditions. </p>
<p>In several organs the expression of VEGF appears to be regulated during development. VEGF plays a role in the development and function of primate follicles and the ovarian corpus luteum, supporting the proliferation of blood vessels. The differentiation of adipocytes, of pheochromocytomas, and myocytes is accompanied by the controlled expression of VEGF. </p>
<p>Borgstrom et al (1996) have shown that treatment of immunodeficient mice (nude and beige nude/xid) carrying a transplanted human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line A673) with a monoclonal antibody specific for VEGF completely inhibits neovascularization of the microtumors and suppresses their growth. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of a VEGF flt-1 or flk-1 receptor gene disruption have been studied in knock-out mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Transgenic mutant mice homozygous for mutations that inactivate either receptor die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5. </p>
<p>Transgenic mutant mice homozygous for a deletion of the VEGF gene have been studied also. Loss of a single VEGF allele is lethal in the mouse embryo between days 11 and 12. Angiogenesis and blood-island formation is impaired, resulting in several developmental anomalies. In addition, embryonic stem cells lacking the VEGF gene exhibit a dramatically reduced ability to form tumors in nude mice. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>VEGF can be assayed by an immunofluorometric test. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>VEGF is important probably in the pathophysiology of neuronal and other tumors, probably functioning as a potent promoter of angiogenesis for human gliomas. Its synthesis is induced also by hypoxia. The extravasation of cells observed as a response to VEGF may be an important factor determining the colonization of distant sites. Due to its influences on vascular permeability VEGF may be involved also in altering blood-brain-barrier functions under normal and pathological conditions. The production of VPF in human malignant glioma cells expressing EGF receptors is significantly increased by EGF. VEGF released by glioma cells in situ most likely accounts for the clinical features of glioblastoma multiforme tumors in patients, including striking tumor angiogenesis, increased cerebral edema and hypercoagulability manifesting as focal tumor necrosis, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. </p>
<p>VEGF secreted from the stromal cells may be responsible for the proliferation of endothelial cells in capillary hemangioblastomas, which are composed of abundant microvasculature and primitive angiogenic elements represented by stromal cells. The production and secretion of VEGF by human retinal pigment epithelial cells may be important in the pathogenesis of ocular neovascularization. </p>
<p>The treatment of nude mice (see also: Immunodeficient mice) carrying transplanted human rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma or leuomyosarcoma cells with antibodies directed against VEGF inhibits tumor growth. The observation that the growth of these tumors in vitro remains unaffected by the antibody demonstrates that the inhibition of angiogenesis in the transplanted tumors is one of the major causes of tumor growth suppression. The expression of VEGF-121 or VEGF-165 in CHO cells confers the ability to form tumors in nude mice. </p>

<h2>fibroblasts</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Fibroblasts are the most ubiquitous cell type within the body and have long been considered to be important structural elements of tissue integrity. It has been recognized that fibroblasts, or distinct subpopulations thereof, perform functions that go beyond that of structural elements. Tissue-specific fibroblasts play an important role as immunoregulatory cells (see also: sentinel cells) that can mount and influence immune responses by being able to secrete chemokines and cytokines, which are able to trigger immune responses by attracting inflammatory cells and immune cells (Smith et al, 1997; Buckley et al, 2001; Kaufman et al, 2001; Silzle et al, 2003, 2004) </p>
<p>Fibroblasts from different anatomical locations show an array of common phenotypic attributes and are capable of expressing multiple regulatory molecules, including cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, cell surface antigens and adhesion molecules, and low molecular weight substances. This enables them to influence their microenvironment, and also to respond to environmental cues, in a complex manner. Fibroblastic cells or fibroblastoid cells have the morphological appearance of fibroblasts. The development of such cells is observed frequently after prolonged culture of a variety of different non-fibroblast cell types. This term does not imply that these cells are fibroblasts. For a cell type showing features of fibroblasts and chondrocytes see also: fibrochondrocytes. </p>
<p>Fibroblasts may, however, show distinct phenotypes in different anatomical locations. Specialized fibroblasts that display morphologic and biochemical features similar to smooth muscle cells are called myofibroblasts. Fibroblast-like cells that are found between the cartilaginous fibers in the synovial membrane of joints are called synoviocytes. Examples of site-specific phenotypes are characteristic expression patterns of receptors (Smith et al, 1993), cell surface molecules (Smith et al, 1995; Fries et al, 1994), gangliosides (Berenson and Smith, 1995; Smith et al, 1997), glycosaminoglycan components of the extracellular matrix (Smith et al, 1997, 1982, 1991, 1995; Smith, 1984, 1987), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (Cao et al, 1995; Hogg et al, 1995; Smith et al, 1992; Smith and Higgins, 1993), and PG endoperoxide H synthase-2 (Wang et al, 1996). Fibroblasts of tumors are known to exhibit distinct expression profiles and also possess different angiogenic and tumorigenic properties (see: Cancer-associated fibroblasts). </p>
<p>The following lists mediators known to be expressed by fibroblasts from various anatomical locations. These factors may have autocrine, paracrine or endocrine functions, affecting many other cell types. Expression of most of these mediators is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and other influences and may differ in fetal, adult, and activated fibroblasts or cells derived from different anatomical locations or different disease conditions. Differences in gene expression patterns most likely reflect intrinsic functional differences such as tissue-specific activities of fibroblast populations. </p>
<p> Fibroblasts have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>epithelial%20cells</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Epithelial cells are cells that line the inner and outer surfaces of the body in continuous sheets (epithelial membranes, usually referred to as epithelia). Epithelial tissues can develop from ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. </p>
<p>Epithelial cells are joined together by cell junctions (tight junctions found only in epithelia, but also adhering junctions and gap junctions, which are found also in other tissues). The epithelial cell layer is attached to the underlying connective tissue by a basement membrane, which is secreted in part by the epithelial cells and the underlying connective tissue cells. </p>
<p>Epithelia do not contain blood vessels and are supplied with nutrients and oxygen by blood vessels in the connective tissue beneath the basement membrane. </p>
<p>The main functions of epithelia are protection (e. g., skin), absorption (e. g., lining of the intestines), and secretion (e. g., lining of the stomach wall). Epithelial exocrine or endocrine glands develop when epithelial cell sheets invaginate into underlying connective tissue and differentiate into cells with secretory functions. </p>
<p>Epithelial cells are classified normally by shape, by the number of cell laters they form, and by their specialization. Squamous epithelial cells are thin and have an irregular flattened shape. They usually occur in simple layers (examples: endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and lymph channels or mesothelium of body cavities). Cuboidal epithelial cells are cube-shaped and usually have their nucleus in the center (the collecting tubules of the kidney consists of single layers of cuboidal epithelial cells). Columnar epithelial cells are longer than wide and the nucleus is usually near the base of the cell. These cells have tiny hairlike projections, called microvilli, which increase the surface area of the cells. Simple epithelia consist of a single layer of cells. Stratified epithelia consist of more than one layer of cells. The cells in the deep cell layer of the multilayered stratified epithelium that lie directly on top of the basal membrane or nearest to it are referred to as basal cells. These cells can regenerate epithelial cells in the more apical layers and have the ability to differentiate into other cell types of the epithelium. </p>

<h2>hepatocytes</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hepatocytes, also referred to as liver parenchymal cells (parenchymal hepatic cells, parenchymal liver cells), are specialized epithelial cells that constitute the main functional cells of the liver. The main type of liver cancers developing from hepatocytes are called hepatoma or hepatocarcinoma (see: hepatocellular carcinoma for expression profile). Ground glass hepatocytes, described first by Hadziyannis et al (1973) have a cytoplasm with the appearance of ground glass. Such cells are a hallmark of chronic HBV infections (Popper, 1975), contain HBsAg, and harbour viral pre-S deletion mutants, which can induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative DNA damage (Wang et al, 2003). The presence of pre-S mutants in sera is associatd with a high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (Su et al, 2008). Yang et al (2009) have reported enhanced expression of VEGF in ground glass hepatocytes, which may facilitate progression from preneoplastic hepatocytes to hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic HBV infection. For a specific mode of hepatocyte cell death see also: lipoapoptosis. </p>
<p>Hepatocytes may constitute 60 to 80 % of the mass of the liver tissue. The remaining tissue is made up of non-parenchymal cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and blood cells. Hepatocytes perform critical metabolic, endocrine, and secretory functions, which includes the synthesis of carbohydrates, cholesterol, bile salts, fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, protein synthesis (acute phase proteins, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, albumin, fibrinogen, prothrombin group of clotting factors, lipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, transferrin), as well as the detoxification and/or modification of exogenous and endogenous substances (drugs, insecticides, steroids, conversion of ammonia to urea) (for review see: Kmiec, 2001). While all hepatocytes may be engaged in these major functions, there is evidence that they constitute a heterogeneous population with respect to the expression and regulation of regulatory mediators, having specific expression patterns dependent on their position within the liver. </p>
<p>The terms small hepatocytes (abbr. SHC) or oval cells are used for cells in the adult liver that are organ-specific stem cells or committed progenitor cells (Mitaka et al, 1995) (see also: hepatoblasts). They are the natural progenitors in tissue regeneration, possess plasticity to differentiate into specialized cells in adult tissues, and are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into hepatocytes (Mitaka, 2002). </p>
<p>Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that hepatocytes have the capacity to express many different bioactive mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Expression of most of these mediators is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and a variety of other parameters, including culture conditions in vitro and disease states in vivo. Waring et al (2003), for example, have used microarray analysis to reveal considerable differences in gene expression between hepatocytes in suspension and hepatocytes attached to collagen. Baker et al (2001) have employed parallel expression monitoring of approximately 8700 rat genes to characterize mRNA changes over time in hepatocyte cultures. This study reveals a classic hepatocyte dedifferentiation response, showing time-dependent regulation of phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes. </p>
<p> Hepatocytes have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>B-cells</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>These cells (called also B-lymphocytes, or generally antibody-producing cells; see also: B-2 cells (B-2 B-cells)) are among the most abundant types of white blood cells (lymphocytes). B-cell populations can be divided into different functionally distinct subsets that differ in their differentiation status, their anatomical localisation, and their developmental lineage (Sagaert and De Wolf-Peeters, 2003; Allman and Pillai, 2008) (see also: B-1 cells (B-1 B-cells) (B-1a cells, B-1b cells), monocytoid B-cells, transitional B-cells (T1 B-cells and T1 B-cells), marginal zone B-cells, follicular B-cells, plasma cells). Subpopulations of B-cells can be distinguished also by their status as functionally polarized effector cells defined by the secretion of distinct cytokines (see: Be1 cells, Be2 cells). For benign immature B-cells that commonly populate the bone marrow of children see: Hematogones. For B-cell functions that go beyond immunoglobulin synthesis see also: regulatory B-cells. </p>
<p>An individual's capacity to mount effective immune responses is determined by the diversity of B-cell pools. The development of B-cells begins in the fetal liver and continues in the bone marrow throughout the lifetime of an organism. B-cells mature in the bone marrow and go through a sequence of at least 5 recognizable developmentral stages. </p>
<p>The precursors of mature B-cells go through a series of defined stages in their development that can be distinguished from one another by the absence or presence of various kinds of genome rearrangements in the antibody locus and/or expression of specific antigens or receptors (see also: B-lymphoid precursor cells) (Bryder and Sigvardsson, 2010; Santos and Borghesi, 2011; Nescakova and Bystricky, 2011).  </p>
<p>Progenitor B-cells (Pre-pro-B-cells) express the germline configuration in both immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain antibody locus, do not express antibodies, express the IL7 receptor, and do not express CD19. These CD34(+) stem cells from which B-cells develop do not express recombinase genes (RAG1, RAG2) or TdT, components of the pre-B-cell receptor comlex (Ig alpha-beta), or Btk. B-cell progenitors are CD34(+) cells that develop into B-cells in several developmental stages. Some of these stages have been identified by the expression of cell surface markers. CD34(+) CD19(-) CD10(+) early B-cells develop into CD34(+) CD19(+) CD10(+) B-cell progenitors (pro-B-cells), which develop into CD34(-) CD19(+) CD10(+) B-cell precursors (pre-B-cells). Pre-pre-B-cells can be separated into early Pro-B-cells, which undergo DJ rearrangement at the heavy chain locus, show the germline configuration at the light chain locus, do not express immunoglobulin, express IL7 receptor but no CD19. These cells express recombinase, TdT, CD34, CD45, and class II antigens. Late Pro-B-cells undergo VDJ rearrangement at the heavy chain locus, show the germline configuration at the light chain locus, do not express immunoglobulin, express IL7 receptor and also CD19. Late pro-B-cells also express CD45R, CD40, class II antigens. Large Pre-B-cells are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, show the germline configuration at the light chain locus, express IgM in the cytoplasm, and express IL7 receptor and also CD19. Large pre-B-cells express the mu chain of the pre-B receptor, and do no longer express recombinases and TdT. Small Pre-B-cells do no longer divide and differ from large pre-B-cells in that they are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, undergo VJ rearrangement at the light chain locus, express IgM in the cytoplasm, and express IL7 receptor and also CD19. Immature B-cells are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, VJ-rearranged at the light chain locus, express IgM on the cell surface, do not express IL7 receptors, and express CD19. Immature B-cells re-express recombinases and TdT, express pre-B-cell receptor comlex (Ig alpha-beta), and express Btk. These cells are very sensitive to antigen binding and die if they are exposed to self-antigens in the bone marrow. Mature B-cells are those that did not bind self antigens. They are VDJ-rearranged at the heavy chain locus, VJ-rearranged at the light chain locus, express IgM and IgD on the cell surface, do not express IL7 receptors, and express CD19. Mature B-cells do not express recombinases and TdT, express pre-B-cell receptor comlex (Ig alpha-beta), and express Btk, CD45R, class II antigens, CD21, and CD40. These cells are mature naive (resting) B-cells. </p>
<p>Each differentiation step appears to be regulated by the expression of distinct transcription factors, receptors, coreceptors, cytokines, and growth factors. Some of the gene expression patterns have been elucidated by utilizing long-term bone marrow cultures, which permit the study of soluble and cell contact signals provided by bone marrow stromal cells and provide information about lineage restriction of developing cells under various conditions. Any abnormalities in the expression of cytokine receptors and/or signal transduction processes can cause functional abnormalities of B-cells. </p>
<p>The various subpopulations of B-cells are distinguished by expression or non-expression of a few CD antigen markers. In mice, immature B-cells are distinguished by high expression of CD24, whereas mature B-cells are characterized by low expression of CD24 (Allman et al, 1992). Innate B-1 cells are identified usually by expression of CD19 and CD5. These cells produce mainly IgM antibodies with low affinities and high cross-reactivity (Kipps, 1989). Conventional B-2 cells are CD19(+) and CD5(-). Transitional B-cells (newly emerging after differentiation and selection in the bone marrow) are CD19(+), CD10(+), CD27(-). Naive B-cells are CD19(+) and CD27(-), and memory B-cells are CD19(+), CD27(+). </p>
<p>Naive B-cells are cells that have not been exposed to antigens yet. They are characterized by a nonproliferative, anti-apoptotic phenotype and the expression of various chemokine and cytokine receptors. The first encounter with antigen happens in the T-cell rich areas of secondary lymphoid organs, where they are activated by antigen-specific T-cells and become germinal center founder B-cells. These founders enter the germinal center and become centroblasts that proliferate and mutate their B-cell receptor. The development of centroblasts is associated with the upregulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation, DNA-repair, and chromatin remodeling and the acquisition of a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Centroblasts develop into centrocytes, which undergo selection after recognizing and capturing antigens on follicular dendritic cells and the presentation of processed antigen to germinal center T-cells. Centroblasts leave the follicle and pass to the cortex medullary sinuses of lymph nodes, where they become immunoblasts. Immunoblasts can be the precursors of either memory B-cells, or plasma cells, the sole function of which is the production of soluble antibodies. Centroblasts (rapidly dividing cells) and centrocytes (non-dividing cells) represent the two major B-cell subsets present in germinal center. Caron et al (2009) have shown that human centroblasts express CXCR4, and can reliably be distinguished from centrocytes, which do not express the chemokine receptor. </p>
<p>Peripheral lymphoid organs contain three major B-cell compartments. The germinal center contains rapidly proliferating B-cells that undergo selection and affinity maturation. The mantle zone contains naive quiescent B-cells. The marginal zone contains mostly memory B-cells. B-cells residing in these compartments have specific functional roles in humoral immune response and also differ in their expression profiles. </p>
<p>B-cells are highly specialized immune cells that have the capacity to bind to antigenic determinants (epitopes) of a soluble antigen by means of the B-cell receptor (BCR). B-cell receptors are integral membrane proteins that are expressed by B-cells without having been exposed to an antigen ligand. B-cell receptors expressed on a B-cell are specific for a particular epitope, i.e., these receptors have a unique binding site. </p>
<p>Antigen binding causes the B-cells to internalize the antigen in a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis, and to present fragments thereof on the cell surface as a complex with class 2 histocompatibility molecules. These complexes are recognized by T-cell receptors expressed on T-helper cells. Cell-to-cell contact by means of B-cell receptors, T-cell receptors, class 2 histocompatibility molecules, in addition to costimulatory signals, causes T-helper cells to secrete cytokines that lead to cell activation of these B-cells. Repeated exposure to the same epitope and various additional co-stimulatory signals cause cell division, which leads to the emergence of identical clones of B-cells that carry B-cell receptors with identical specificity. Subsequently, these B-cells differentiate into plasma cells, all of which express a soluble version of the original B-cell receptor with unique specificity. These soluble versions of the B-cell receptor are called antibodies and are reactive to almost all potential pathogens. </p>
<p>Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that B-cells have the capacity to express many different bioactive mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. A variety of studies have been published to compare gene expression profiles of normal and malignant B-cells or B-cells lacking specific genes required for their development (Wang et al, 2004; Lindvall et al, 2004; Chtanova et al, 2004; Hoffmann et al, 2003; Ollila and Vihinen, 2003; Klein et al, 2003; van Anken et al, 2003; Hogerkorp et al, 2002; Ek et al, 2002; Islam et al, 2002; Hoffmann et al, 2002; Husson et al, 2002; Klein et al, 2001; Chu and Paul, 1998). </p>
<p>Expression of some of the proteins listed below is constitutive but the expression of most is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, cell activation, stage of differentiation, resting or activated cells, and/or cells residing in different anatomical localization, or the degree of malignancy or association with particular disease states. The following list of mediators makes no distinction between B-cell subsets and/or cells from different anatomical locations, or species etc. </p>
<p>B-cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>T-cells</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>These cells (called also T-lymphocytes) are among the most abundant types of white blood cells (lymphocytes). T-cells are highly specialized cells that have the capacity to bind to bind to an antigenic determinant (epitope) of a cell-bound antigen by means of the T-cell receptor (TCR). The cells presenting the cell surface antigen recognized by the T-cell receptor are called antigen-presenting cell (APC). The designation Tconv [conventional T-cells] is used frequently to distinguish these cells, which provide clonal antigen-specific responses, from more specialized subpopulations, referred to sometimes as unconventional T-cells, such as regulatory T-cells, NKT-cells or MAIT cells (Pennington et al, 2005; Gapin, 2009). </p>
<p>T-cells develop from T-lymphoid precursor cells. The earliest progenitors of T-cells are produced in the bone marrow. These cells are called T-cells because the development and selection of mature immunologically competent T-cells occurs in the thymus. During their residence in the thymus, precursors of T-cells develop into thymocytes. The thymus can be divided into an outer cortex and inner medulla. Immature thymocytes are present in the outer cortex of the thymus. Mature thymocytes are present in the inner medulla of the thymus. </p>
<p>Thymocytes divide rapidly and their numbers increase enormously in a relatively short period of time. Thymocytes pass from the cortex to the medulla before emerging as immunocompetent cells in the peripheral circulation. The predominant thymocyte subsets in the medulla are CD4(+) CD8(-) and CD4(-) CD8(+) cells, which leave the thymus to populate the periphery. In the context of T-cell biology these cells are variously referred to as single-positive cells (single-positive thymocytes) or single-negative cells (single-negative thymocytes). Specialized complexes of thymic stromal epithelial cells and CD4(+) CD8(+) thymocytes in the cortex, called 'nurse cells', may provide a specialized microenvironment for the development of thymocyte. The corticomedullary junction - the boundary between cortex and medulla is rich in macrophages and dendritic cells. The macrophages prevent the passage of damaged or dying cells into the medulla. Dendritic cells are important for the negative selection of T-cells in the thymus. Thymocytes that leave the thymus take up residence in areas of the lymph nodes and spleen called T-dependent zones. From this time on they are known as T-cells. </p>
<p>Two distinct lineages of T-cells are generated in the thymus. They are identified by the two different types of T-cell receptors they express. The first cells to develop are so-called Gamma-Delta T-cells. These are prominent during embryonic thymic development, represent a small minority population of T-cells in the peripheral blood but a major subset in other anatomical locations, and their development may involve also extrathymic sites. Ribot et al (2009) have shown that most Gamma-Delta T-cells express CD27 and secrete IFN-gamma, whereas IL17 production is restricted to CD27(-)Gamma-Delta T-cells. For skin-resident cells see: dendritic epidermal T-cells. Meissner et al (2003) have reported expression profiles for Gamma-Delta T-cells. </p>
<p>Alpha-Beta T-cells represent the majority of thymocytes in the thymus and T-cells in the periphery. With regard to effector functions, there are no major differences between Gamma-Delta T-cells and Alpha-Beta T-cells. However, The two cell types are thought to differ from each other in terms of the ligands recognized by the two different kinds of T-cell receptors (Kabelitz et al, 2007; Hayday, 2000). Subtypes of activated human Gamma-Delta T-cells, referred to as Vdelta1(+) T-cells (resident cells) and Vdelta2(+) T-cells (circulating cells; called also Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T-cells), appears to function as antigen-presenting cells with a potency and efficacy similar to tat observed for dendritic cells. (Moser and Brandes, 2006; Ferrarini et al, 2002). These cells use the T-cell receptor as a pattern recognition receptor to sense infections and also respond to microbial metabolites (Beetz et al, 2008). </p>
<p>Immature thymocytes undergo a selection process in the thymus. Two types of functionally different T-cells are distinguished depending on the type of glycoprotein cell surface marker (CD4 or CD8) they express on their cell surface. Immature T-cells do not express a T-cell receptor and also do not express CD4 or CD8. Such cells are called double-negative cells [double-negative thymocytes, double-negative T-cells, DN cells, DN thymocytes]. In the cortex of the thymus these cells begin to express T-cell receptor, and CD4 as well as CD8 (double-positive thymocytes, double-positive T-cells, double-positive cells, DP cells, DP thymocytes). Double-positive cells differentiate by a process of positive selection into cell types that express either CD4 or CD8. These cells migrate to the medulla of the thymus. Cells that have the capacity to recognize self-antigens in conjunction with MHC molecules are eliminated by negative selection. Surviving cells leave the thymus and eventually participate in immune reponses against foreign antigens. Positive selection is mediated by cortical epithelial cells and ensures that mature T-cells have the potential to recognise foreign peptide in association with self-MHC. Negative selection removes potentially dangerous T-cells that recognise self-peptides. These cells undergo cell death by apoptosis. </p>
<p>T-cells expressing CD4 bind epitopes of antigens that are presented on the surface of cells in a complex with class 2 histocompatibility molecules (B-cells, phagocytic cells such as macrophages, and dendritic cells). Upon binding to another cell, these T-cells release other cytokines that are chemotactic for a variety of other cell types, which then migrate to this area and cause inflammation. These cell-to-cell interactions and the mediators that are released during this process are responsible for the process of cell-mediated immunity. Special CD4(+) cells, called T-helper cells, bind to antigens presented on B-cells and are responsible for antibody-mediated immunity. These helper T-cell populations have been shown to comprise distinct subpopulations that are being referred to generally as polarized T-cells, which differ in their expression profiles. For examples see: Th0 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th3 cells, Th5 cells, Th6 cells, Th9 cells, Th17 cells, Th22 cells. T-cells expressing CD8 bind epitopes of antigens that are presented on the surface of cells in a complex with class 1 histocompatibility molecules (most cell types of the body). One example of such cells are cytotoxic T-cells (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, abbr. CTL), which have the capacity to secrete factors such as granzymes and perforins and others, which destroy the cell to which they have bound. Subtypes of cytotoxic T-cells are known as Tc1 cells and Tc2 cells. They are distinguished by the types of receptors they express and by the types of cytokines they secrete. Maekawa et al (2008) have shown T-cells lacking expression of that Notch-2 have impaired differentiation into cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>For a special subpopulation of T-cells that have the capability of suppressing immune responses see: regulatory T-cells (suppressor T-cells). </p>
<p>Wang et al (2008) have compared the expression profiles of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T-cells and have identified a number of genes involved in cell activation of T-cells. Cao et al (2010) have reported a comparison of gene expression profiles of CD8(+) T-cells from aged and young healthy subjects. </p>
<p> Currently, the list below does not distinguish between individual subclasses or subpopulations of T-cells. T-cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>CD4</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This cell surface antigen is known also as T4, Leu3, OKT4 or L3T4 (murine), Ly4 (murine), or W3/25 and OX38 or OX35 (rat). CD4 is a 55 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In humans CD4 is expressed of peripheral T-cells, thymocytes, on macrophages and granulocytes. It is expressed also in a developmentally regulated manner in specific regions of the brain. The human CD4 gene is on chromosome 12pter-p12. </p>
<p>Progenitors T-cells in the thymus initially do not express CD4 and another antigen called CD8 and develop into mature T-cells in several steps. CD4(+) cells are T-helper cells that, upon cell activation, produce a number of different cytokines and play a role in the activation and/or proliferation of B-cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. </p>
<p> FACS analysis of thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes This graphic shows the results obtained by analyzing fluorescence intensity of thymocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes labelled with fluorescent antibodies directed against CD4 or CD8. Populations of thymocytes contain double-negative (yellow) and double-positive (light blue) cell types while peripheral blood lymphocytes contain no double-positive cells but only single positive or double-negative cells. Arrows indicate increasing fluorescence intensity (log10 fluorescence). </p>
<p> CD4 acts as a cellular adhesion molecule binding MHC class 2 molecules. It stabilizes the interaction of MHC class 2 restricted T-cells and antigen-presenting cells expressing an antigen in combination with a MHC class 2 molecule. Interactions of CD4 with MHC class 2 molecules are crucial during thymic development and subsequently for the function of single-positive CD4(+) CD8(-) T-lymphocytes (see also XLCM). </p>
<p>CD4 also acts as a receptor for HIV but requires cosignals (see also: CCR5). Another ligand of CD4 is LCF (lymphocyte chemoattractant factor). The expression of CD4 in brain suggest that it may play a more general role in mediating cell recognition events than merely those of cellular immune responses. </p>
<p>Thymocytes, which are CD4(+) and CD8(-) produce factors such as IL4, IL5, IL10 and IFN-gamma (see also: T-helper). </p>
<p>CD4 functions as an effector molecule for intracellular signal transduction. In T-lymphocytes CD4 has been found to be associated with tyrosine kinase lck which phosphorylates a number of other cell surface proteins (including CD3) and is involved probably in transducing the intracellular signal when these proteins are bound to their receptors (see also: HT-2 cell line). </p>
<p>Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD4 inhibit several cellular functions in vitro and have been used, among other things, to treat autoimmune diseases in experimental animals. At present, these antibodies, and also antibody-toxin chimeras are tested as drugs against infections with HIV. One particular class of genetically engineered proteins, known as immunoadhesins, are fusion proteins combining the constant Fc region of IgG with the CD4 receptor domain acting as a binding site for pg120 protein of HIV. Such fusion proteins therefore contain an additional functional constant region of the IgG antibody and can be used to eliminate cells and viruses expressing the corresponding antigens. </p>
<p>Pluripotent murine hematopoietic stem cells have been shown also to express the CD4 antigen. The CD4(+) cells isolated from mouse marrow repopulate all hematopoietic lineages in several assays (see: BMC, bone marrow culture; MRA, marrow repopulating ability), indicating that this population contains primitive stem cells with extensive repopulation capacity. This also suggests that CD4 may play an important role also in lineage definition in early hematopoietic differentiation (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The expression of IL4 in transgenic animals blocks the maturation of T-cells and considerably reduces the population of immature CD4(+) CD8(+) thymocytes and peripheral T-cells while at the same time greatly enhancing the numbers of CD8(+) mature thymocytes. </p>
<p>In CD4(-) knock-out mouse strains the development of CD8(+) cells proceeds normally although the activity of helper cells is greatly reduced. The proliferation of thymocytes with the marker spectrum [(CD4(-) CD8(-)], [(CD4(+) CD8(-)], [CD4(-) CD8(+)] is stimulated by IL7 which is therefore an important developmental factor for functionally different subpopulations of T-lymphocytes. </p>

<h2>CD8</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This cell surface antigen is known also as T8, Leu2, Lyt2 or OKT8. CD8 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. </p>
<p>CD8 occurs either as a disulfide-linked homodimer or homomultimer of two 34 kDa subunits (CD8-alpha = CD8a = Lyt2, Ly2, OX8) or as a heterodimer complexed with another protein named CD8-beta (= CD8b = Lyt3, Ly3) of which there are multiple forms arising by alternative splicing of its mRNA. Alternative splicing may lead also to the synthesis of a secreted form of CD8-alpha which may form homodimers also. Devine et al (2000) have reported that human CD8-beta, but not mouse CD8-beta, can be expressed in the absence of CD8-alpha as a beta beta homodimer. </p>
<p>The human genes encoding CD8-alpha (approximately 8 kb, 6 exons) and CD8-beta map to chromosome 2p12, lying in close proximity to each other. These genes are linked closely also to the immunoglobulin kappa light chain cluster. </p>
<p>Progenitors of T-cells in the thymus initially do not express CD8 and another antigen called CD4 and develop into mature T-cells in several steps. Immature thymocytes later coexpress CD8 and CD4, and these cells give rise to mature T-cells, which are either CD4(+) CD8(-) or CD4(-) CD8(+) (see also DN1 cells, DN2 cells, DN3 cells). Those T-cells that recognize self-MHC are selected to mature by a process known as positive selection in which MHC class 1 generates an instructive signal that directs differentiation to a CD8 lineage. </p>
<p> FACS analysis of thymocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes This graphic shows the results obtained by analyzing fluorescence intensity of thymocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes labelled with fluorescent antibodies directed against CD4 or CD8. Populations of thymocytes contain double-negative (yellow) and double-positive (light blue) cell types while peripheral blood lymphocytes contain no double-positive cells but only single positive or double-negative cells. Arrows indicate increasing fluorescence intensity (log10 fluorescence). </p>
<p> CD8 is required for the development of cytotoxic T-cells but not for the development of T-helper cells. CD8 functions as an adhesion molecule that binds MHC class 1 molecules. Antibodies against CD8 can block the killing activity of cytotoxic cells by inhibiting target cell adhesion. </p>
<p>In CD4(+) cells the expression of CD8 can be induced by IL4. The expression of IL4 in transgenic animals blocks the maturation of T-cells and considerably reduces the population of immature thymocytes expressing both CD4 and CD8, and peripheral T-cells while at the same time greatly enhancing the numbers of CD8(+) mature thymocytes. The proliferation of thymocytes with the marker spectrum CD4(-) CD8(-), CD4(+) CD8(-), CD4(-) CD8(+) is stimulated by IL7 which is therefore an important developmental factor for functionally different subpopulations of T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>CD8 functions as an effector molecule for intracellular signal transduction. In T-lymphocytes CD8 has been found to be associated with tyrosine kinase lck which phosphorylates a number of other cell surface proteins (including CD3) and is involved probably in transducing the intracellular signal when these proteins are bound to their receptors (see also: HT-2 cell line). </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The functional consequences of CD4 expression in a population of class 1-selected CD8(+) lymphocytes have been investigated in a transgenic mouse line in which a CD4 transgene is expressed on a significant fraction of the mature CD8(+) lymphocytes but not in the thymus. CD8(+) lymphocytes expressing the CD4 transgene proliferate in response to allogeneic class 1 and class 2 major histocompatibility complex, whereas CD8(+) cells from control animals proliferate only to allogeneic class 1 gene products. The ability of a T-cell population to react with class 2 allogeneic major histocompatibility complex is therefore determined by the presence of CD4. </p>
<p>CD8(+) cells are cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that are capable of lysing target cells by direct cell contact. These cells play a role in the elimination of virus-infected cells and tumor cells and are also involved in transplant rejection processes. </p>
<p>Transgenic knock-out mice lacking CD8 have been generated by homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells (see: ES cells) and bred with the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-susceptible PL/JH-2u to investigate the role of T-cells expressing the marker CD8 in this model of multiple sclerosis. The disease onset and susceptibility were similar to those of wild-type mice. However, the mutant mice had a milder acute EAE, reflected by fewer deaths, but more chronic EAE, reflected by a higher frequency of relapse. This suggests that T-lymphocytes expressing CD8 may participate as both effectors and regulators in this animal model (for a role of CD8(+) cells in parasitemia see also: Beta-2-Microglobulin. </p>

<p>Numerous isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of NCAM mRNA have been reported. Adult tissues express three major isoforms. The 120 kDa protein NCAM-120 is linked to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The 140 kDa NCAM-140 has a transmembrane component and a cytoplasmic tail with unknown function. A 180 kDa isoform (NCAM-180) binds the cytoskeleton. NCAM-180 is the isoform found in colonocytes, and loss of expression is associated with clinically aggressive colon cancers. For E-NCAM [embryonic NCAM], a highly polysialylated embryonic form of this protein, see: NCAM. </p>
<p>The antigen is expressed on natural killer cells (80-90%), T-cells after cell activation, at neuromuscular junctions, in normal neuroendocrine tissues, Schwann cells. </p>
<p>Paratcha et al (2003) have reported that the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is an alternative signaling receptor for GDNF family ligands that operates independently of ret, the signaling component of the GDNF receptor. </p>
<p>Thoulouze et al (1998) have reported that CD56 can serve as a receptor for rabies virus. </p>
<p>Palser et al (2009) have suggested that NCAM may play a role in axon / oligodendrocyte signalling during myelination, leading to an increase in oligodendrocyte survival and process outgrowth following axonal contact. </p>

<h2>lymphocytes</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Lymphocytes are the primary cells of an immune response. Most lymphocytes are located in lymphoid tissues and only a very small portion circulate in the blood. The most important types are the T-cells, B-cells, and mature B-cells (plasma cells). </p>
<p>The process leading to the formation of lymphocytes is called lymphopoiesis. Initial lymphopoiesis takes place in bone marrow. Maturation takes places in lymph nodes, and the thymus. These initial phases of lymphopoiesis do not require exposure of the cells to antigens. An antigen-dependent phase of lymphopoiesis involves a second cycle of differentiation and proliferation when the cells are exposed to antigens (Golden-Mason and O'Farrelly, 2002; Hirose et al, 2002; Medina and Singh, 2005; Plum and Leclercq, 2000). </p>
<p>The neoplastic transformation and proliferation of morphologically immature lymphocytes leads to Acute lymphoid leukemia (called also Acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; abbr. ALL). This can involve B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. The neoplastic transformation and proliferation of lymphoid cells that usually involves a morphologically mature lymphocytes leads to Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). </p>

<h2>dendritic%20cells</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The term dendritic cells pertains to a heterogeneous group of multifunctional leukocytes with different phenotypical and functional differences rather than a distinct cell type (Bodey et al, 1997; Jacobs et al, 2008; for a detailed analysis of expression profiles in mouse and human subpopulations of dendritic cells see also: Robbins et al, 2008). These cells are regenerated continuously from hematopoietic stem cells and have a common progenitor identified as common dendritic progenitor). The term BMDC [bone marrow-derived dendritic cells] refers to such cells as found in the bone marrow. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells exist in at least two states, i.e., as immature dendritic cells and mature dendritic cells. Maturation requires a number of maturation signals (Banchereau et al, 2000; Lutz and Schuler, 2002). </p>
<p>The term myeloid dendritic cells (abbr. often MDC) refers to dendritic cells obtained from myeloid precursor cells. This term is used also to differentiate these cells from another subset of dendritic cells known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (see below). Both cell types represent about 0.2-0.4 % of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in peripheral blood (Krug et al, 2001). </p>
<p>The terms standard dendritic cells or conventional dendritic cells (abbr. cDC) are used frequently to refer to murine CD8-alpha(+) cells expressing high levels of CD11c (Shortman and Liu, 2002) that enter lymph nodes by migrating from peripheral tissues via the lymphatic route. This term is used to distinguish these cells from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (see below). In humans, these cells are identified by BDCA1 and BDCA3 (Narbutt et al, 2004). The term lymph node-resident dendritic cells (abbr. LN-DC) is used as a general term comprising conventional dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. </p>
<p>The term monocyte-derived dendritic cells (abbr. often MoDC) refers to a population of dendritic cells obtain by in vitro maturation from monocytes (see below; see also: dendritic cell-related cells). </p>
<p>The term alpha-Type-1 polarized dendritic cells (abbr. alpha-DC1 cells) refers to a population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells that secrete IL12 and express CCR7 obtained during growth in serum-free medium and treatment with a maturation cocktail containing TNF-alpha, IL1-beta, poly-I:C, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma (Mailliard et al, 2004). Gustafsson et al (2008) have reported that, depending on the maturation protocol, these cells also secrete high amounts of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells are found in the interstitial spaces of many organs (Hart and Fabre, 1981), often in close association with epithelial cells (Holt et al, 1987; Maric et al, 1996). Tissues include the skin (Schuler and Steinman, 1985), airways (Holt et al, 1987, 1990), mucosa (Cook et al, 2000), lymphoid organs (Steinman and Cohn, 1974; Hart and McKenzie, 1988), afferent lymphatics (Drexhage et al, 1979; Knight et al, 1982; Pugh et al, 1983; Bujdoso et al, 1989), circumscribed medullary regions of the thymus (Barclay and Mayrhofer, 1981; Agger et al, 1992), liver portal triads (Matsuno et al, 1996) and sinusoids (Kudo et al, 1997), blood (Van Voorhis et al, 1983). These cells may differ from each other in their maturational states and the different pathways taken in the course of differentiation. In addition, these cells may differ also with respects to individual functions and phenotypes. </p>
<p>The studies of various knock-out mice has provided genetic evidence for the existence of two cell lineages of dendritic cells that develop from myeloid precursors or lymphoid precursors. Lymphoid dendritic cells are lacking in mice carrying mutations in the Ikaros gene (Wu et al, 1997). Mice lacking transcription factor relB are deficient in myeloid dendritic cells but have a normal complement of Langerhans cells, which are considered the epidermal counterpart of myeloid dendritic cells (Wu et al, 1998). Mice lacking expression of TGF-beta-1 lack Langerhans cells but normally possess other subsets of dendritic cells (Wu et al, 1997; Kulkarni et al, 1993; Borkowski et al, 1996; Strobl et al, 1996). Cytokines and growth factors and other mediators acting on dendritic cells to influence development, maturation, and functional capacities have been termed DC-poietins. </p>
<p>There is no single cell surface marker that can be used to identify dendritic cells. Dendritic cells express high levels of MHC class 2 antigens. They do not express surface markers for T-cells (CD3, CD16, CD19, CD28), monocytes (CD14, B-cells (CD19, CD20, immunoglobulins), natural killer cells (CD16, CD56, CD57), granulocytes (CD66b). They express a variety of adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD11c, CD50, CD54, CD58, CD102), and costimulatory molecules, which are upregulated during cell activation (Banchereau et al, 2000). CD86 is expressed predominantly in early phases of dendritic cell maturation. CD80 is expressed mainly on mature cells. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells play an important role in initiating adaptive immune responses by capturing micro-organisms that have entered peripheral mucosal tissues. Subsequently, these cells migrate to secondary lymphoid organs and present the captured and processed antigens to resting T-cells. </p>
<p>Depending upon their anatomical localization, various names are used for dendritic cells. They are known also as veiled cells (or veil cells; dendritic cells in lymph) (Knight et al, 1982; Brand et al, 1993), or reticular cells (Steinman et al, 1997). Human blood contains two subsets of dendritic cells, one immunologically mature and the other immature (O'Doherty et al, 1994). Mature dendritic cells originate from myeloid committed CD34(+) progenitor cells (Caux et al, 1996) (see also: CFU-DC). They can be derived also from CD14(+) monocytes (Romani et al, 1996; Bender et al, 1996). Both cell types develop into dendritic cells in the presence of certain cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL4) (Inaba et al, 1992; Caux et al, 1992) and are known as interstitial dendritic cells. They express CD14, CD68, factor IIIa and are present in the dermis and most organs (Holt, 1993; Nestle et al, 1998; Sallusto et al, 1995). It is thought that these cells migrate to the lymphoid follicles and become follicular dendritic cells. They are called dendritic cells because of their morphology rather than any lineage relationship with dendritic cells. Lymphoid dendritic cells present in blood and lymphoid organs express CD4, CD11c, CD13 CD33, and CD123 (Grouard et al, 1997). A marker of mature dendritic cells is CD83 (Zhou and Tedder, 1996). The term FastDC has been used for dendritic cells obtained with a maturation protocol that accelerates the development and maturation of dendritic cells from monocytes, employing treatment with GM-CSF and IL4, followed by activation with pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL1-beta, IL6, PGE2). These cells express mature dendritic cell surface markers, CCR7, and secrete IL12 upon CD40 ligation in the presence of IFN-gamma. The cells possess full T-cell stimulatory capacity and can be derived from human monocytes within only 48 hours of in vitro culture instead of other protocols that require 7 days of cultivation (Dauer et al, 2003, 2005). </p>
<p>Folliculo-stellate cells (abbr. FSC) are a type of dendritic cells found in the anterior pituitary. </p>
<p>Langerhans cells (epidermal dendritic cells) are dendritic cells maturing under the influence of cytokines (TNF-alpha) from CD34(+) myeloid cells that are CD14(-) (Ito et al, 1999). These cells are capable of activating naive T-cells but cannot activate B-cells. Migratory dendritic cells are those that have migrated out of skin ex vivo. Dermal dendritic cells are specialized cells found in the dermis of the skin. They are more frequent than Langerhans cells, differ in their marker spectrum from other dendritic cell types, and have the same capacity as Langerhans cells to present antigens and to activate T-cells. </p>
<p>Inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells constitute a subset of dendritic cells found exclusively in inflammatory skin lesions. Unlike Langerhans cells, these cells do not contain Birbeck granules. They express CD1a, CD11b and MHC class 2 molecules (Wollenberg et al, 1996). These cells express the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (Schuller et al, 2001), engage in endocytosis via the mannose receptor (Wollenberg et al, 2002), and express Fc-epsilon R1. They are the principal epidermal dendritic cells involved in binding IgE in atopic dermatitis (Wollenberg et al, 1999). </p>
<p>A population of medium-sized mononuclear cells with plasmacytoid features in the T-cell zones of human lymphoid tissues, and in the thymus and lymph nodes of patients with various inflammatory and neoplastic diseases has been shown to express several antigens expressed on myelomonocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. These cells, which lack markers for B-cells and plasma cells have been referred to as plasmacytoid monocytes, T-associated plasma cells, or plasmacytoid T-cells (Lennert and Remmele, 1958; Facchetti et al, 2003) and are the same as natural IFN-producing cells (Colonna et al, 2004). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (abbr. often PDC, and so named for historical reasons referring to histological similarities to antibody-producing plasma cells) (Grouard et al, 1997; Siegal et al, 1999), which are being referred to also as lymphoid-related dendritic cells, are derived from CD34(+) cells committed to the lymphoid lineage. These cells enter lymphoid tissues directly from the blood (Cella et al, 1999). They constitute a subset of dendritic cells that do not express CD11c, are negative for myeloid markers, express high levels of CD45RA and IL3 receptors (IL3RA, interleukin-3 receptor-alpha, IL3R-alpha, common beta, beta c, betac, common cytokine receptor-beta, cytokine receptor common subunit beta, IL3RB, IL3 receptor subunit beta, IL3R-beta, IL3 receptor subunit beta; interleukin-3 receptor-beta, IL5RB, IL5 receptor subunit beta, IL5R-beta, GM-CSF receptor subunit beta, CSF2RB, colony stimulating factor-2 receptor-beta, CD131) and have been shown to express the BST-2 antigen. These cells are identical with a cell type described as natural IFN-producing cells or IFN-producing cells (abbr. NIPC, IPC) (Kadowaki et al, 2000; Cella et al, 1999; Siegal et al, 1999; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al, 1988; Sandberg et al, 1989). Human Germinal center dendritic cells (Grouard et al, 1996) are immature dendritic cells. They express CD11c, CD45R0, CD13, CD33 and are found in within secondary lymphoid organs in areas containing B-cells. Interdigitating cells (see also: interdigitating reticulum cells) (Bjrck et al, 1997; de Saint-Vis et al, 1998; Res et al, 1999) are mature dendritic cells found in areas of peripheral lymphoid organs containing T-cells such as the spleen, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches). These cells express the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (Bjrck et al, 1997) and the specific DC maturation marker DC-LAMP (de Saint-Vis et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Dendritic cells have a short life span. At the various anatomical sites they undergo cell death by apoptosis after a certain time and are replaced by new cells (Holt et al, 1994; Steinman et al, 1974; Kamath et al, 2000; Henri et al, 2001; Schoenberger and Toes, 1998). The mature form of dendritic cells is an end stage of differentiation from which the cells cannot revert into either macrophages or lymphocytes. Dendritic cells are considerably rarer than macrophages but can be obtained in large numbers by ex vivo expansion from CD34(+) bone marrow-derived precursor cells or monocytes (Caux et al, 1996, 1997; Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994; Freudenthal and Steinman, 1990; Thomas et al, 1993; Fong and Engleman, 2000; Syme and Gluck, 2001). Flt-3 ligand (Marakovsky et al, 1996; Pulendran et al, 1997), GM-CSF (Daro et al, 2000; Pulendran et al, 1999), and G-CSF (Arpinati et al, 2000; Pulendran et al, 2000) have been shown to expand distinct subpopulations of dendritic cells in vivo. </p>
<p>Subpopulations of dendritic cells differ in phenotype, functions, and tissue localization (Shortman, 2000; Pulendran et al, 2001). Dendritic cells undergo phenotypic and functional changes during their maturation and migration. Trafficking of dendritic cells to distinct anatomical locations involves the coordinated regulation and expression of chemokines and their receptors (Sozzani et al, 2000) but also of selectins, and integrins (D'Amico et al, 1998). Dendritic cells are not proliferating cells. All cells play an important role in primary and secondary immunological reactions throughout the body. These cells are potent regulators of the immune system by virtue of their ability to present antigens ingested via phagocytosis (Austyn, 1996) or receptor-mediated endocytosis (Sallusto et al, 1995), to induce a primary immune response in resting naive T-cells, and to secrete a plethora of mediators that can affect a variety of other cell types (Lipscomb and Masten, 2002; Cutler et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Dendritic cells can cause cell activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Antigens are captured, processed and presented on the cell surface of dendritic cells together with MHC class 1 to activate CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cells or with MHC class 2 molecules to activate CD4(+) T-helper cells. Dendritic cells are involved also in processes leading to immune tolerance, which involves negative selection of self-reactive T-cells in the thymus (Steinman and Nussenzweig, 2002). Some of the cytokines and factors produced by dendritic cells are critical to the cell activation and differentiation of B-cells. Follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers of lymph nodes are thought to be able to cause long-term stimulation of B-cells, which can take up antigens from these cells and present it to T-cells. </p>
<p>Studies are now in progress to determine the most effective way of using activated dendritic cells pulsed, for example, with autologous tumor lysates, for immunotherapy in human patients (Fong and Engleman, 2000). Dendritic cells are known to secrete exosomes constitutively. These exosomes constitute a membrane vesicle population (60-80 nm) of endocytic origin and bear MHC molecules and a variety of costimulatory proteins, as well as adhesion proteins and a variety of proteins related to apoptosis (Thery et al, 2001). Exosomes resemble apoptotic vesicles but are biochemically and morphologically distinct. Exosomes can induce potent anti-tumor immune responses in vivo in the same way as dendritic cells themselves and can cause rejection of established tumors in mice (Chaput et al, 2003). </p>
<p>Rodent myeloid dendritic cells promote Th2 differentiation (Pulendran et al, 1999; Maldonado-Lopez et al, 1999). Rodent lymphoid dendritic cells are major producers of IL12 and are engaged in Th1 cell responses. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC1 cells; type 1 dendritic cells, called also Th1-inducing dendritic cells, or myeloid-related dendritic cells) induce Th1 cells (Rissoan et al, 1999). Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC2 cells; type 2 dendritic cells), called also Th1-inducing dendritic cells, elicit Th2 cell responses, produce IFN-gamma but no IL12 (Siegal et al, 1999; Cella et al, 1999). Hata et al (2009) have compiled the gene profile dominantly expressed in DC2 cells.  </p>
<p>Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that dendritic cells have the capacity to express many different bioactive mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Expression of some of these proteins is constitutive but expression of most is subject to modulation by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, cell activation, stage of differentiation, and/or anatomical localization. In addition, expression may differ among different strains of experimental animals. Frequently, only a subset of dendritic cells may express these proteins (see also my remarks under cell types). For examples of microarray analyses comparing expression patterns of cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins in different subsets of dendritic cells see also: Sun et al (2003), Skelton et al (2003), Grolleau et al (2003), Nagorsen et al (2004); Chen et al, 2001. Chaussabel et al (2003) have compared gene expression profiles in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages generated in vitro from the same individual blood donors and exposed to 5 different pathogens. These analyses demonstrate dendritic cells and macrophages constitutively express approximately 4000 genes, 96% of which are shared between the 2 cell types. Unique expression patterns are found in response to each pathogen. Ishii et al (2005) have identified approximately 2000 genes that are upregulated by stimulation with bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell-wall skeleton. </p>
<p>Dendritic cells have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>Killer%20cells</h2>
<p>abbr. K cells (a term with multiple meanings). K cells are cytotoxic cells. They are large lymphocytes that do not express surface markers found commonly on either T-cells or B-cells. K cells can be activated specifically by antigen through IgG, using Fc receptors. The term has been used for NK-cells when they participate in immune reactions as mediators of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. </p>

<h2>LAK%20cells</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>[lymphokine-activated killer cells] These cells constitute a subpopulation of peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells that are collected from tumor patients and expanded in vitro by treatment with IL2. The cells are being referred to also as T-LAK cells (referring to the fact that they have been induced from T-cells and have a T-cell phenotype). Higher yields of LAK cells may be obtained by treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with lectin and then with recombinant IL2 (LILAK cells). </p>
<p>LAK cells develop a broad range of lytic activity against fresh tumor cells and cultured tumor cell lines. Approximately 10**10 autologous ex vivo-activated LAK cells are re-infused into tumor patients for the treatment of various tumors (see: Adoptive immunotherapy). </p>
<p>Approximately 90 % of the LAK cells are derived from precursor cells with the immunological marker spectrum CD3(-), CD11(+), CD14(-), CD16(+), CD56(+). Following their activation they carry the markers CD2(+), CD3(-), CD56(+) and hence are activated NK-cells. These cells are being referred to also as NK-LAK cells (referring to the fact that they have been induced from NK-cells and have an NK-cell phenotype). IL2 activation also induces a significant increase in the expression of the CD25 antigen which functions as an IL2 receptor. LAK cells also express a biochemically uncharacterized cell surface antigen called LAK-1. LAK cells display an MHC-unrestricted cytolysis against a wide variety of fresh and cultured tumor cells. </p>
<p>The molecular basis of the interactions between LAK cells and their target cell has not yet been elucidated in detail. Binding to target cells involves Fc receptors on the LAK cell and several other receptors including the complement factor-3 receptor and several intercellular adhesion molecules and their ligands (see also: ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity). CD58 (LFA-3), CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) adhesion molecules are some of the molecules regulating non-specific major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted and CD3/T-cell receptor (TcR)-triggered cytotoxicity. </p>
<p>Some factors effectively mediating the lysis of tumor cells by LAK cells are Perforins (induced by IL2), and Leukalexins, both of which permeabilise cellular membranes. Cell lysis also involves proteolytic enzymes (granzymes) and cytotoxic NK-cell factors such as NKCF (Natural killer cytotoxic factor). Some observations suggest in addition to rapid cytolysis, antitumor activities of LAK cells also involve slow-acting cytokine production. They appear to secrete, for example, a cytotoxic factor of approximately 57 kDa into the conditioned medium. A cytotoxic factor found in the membrane fractions of adherent LAK cells is M-CTX. Membrane-bound forms of TNF-alpha may contribute also to cell lysis. </p>
<p>Several protocols have been developed to generate LAK cells and to enhance their cytolytic activities. It appears that many different cytokines and other substances are involved in the initial generation of LAK cell activities either as autocrine or paracrine modulators. </p>
<p>Adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells (abbr. ALAK) are isolated from peripheral blood-derived non-MHC restricted LAK cells by in vitro cultivation of LAK cells on nylon fibres or plastic surfaces. These cells are approximately up to 10-fold more cytotoxic than non-adherent cells. Some of this increased cytotoxicity may be the result of cell activation, which is known to be initiated by mere contact of cells with inert surfaces, and the resulting enhanced production of cytokines. </p>
<p>The aggressiveness of LAK cells can be enhanced also by in vitro treatment with TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha appears to promote the migration of lymphocytes into the tumor (see also TIL, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) while IFN-gamma increases the expression of the major histocompatibility antigens. An increased cytotoxic activity of LAK cells may be obtained also by treatment with IL4. The addition of GM-CSF in the presence of IL2 during the induction of LAK cells has been described also to enhance the number of effector cells with substantial cytotoxic activity. The IL2 induced LAK activity is also significantly upregulated in the presence of cisplatin and FK565 (see also: CsA, cyclosporin A). Purified protein A from Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain in combination with IL2 significantly enhances the cytotoxicity and lytic ability of LAK cells against tumor cells that are sensitive or resistant to NK-cells. Cultivation of LAK cells at higher oxygen concentrations also appears to promote their generation and to enhance their functional activities. L-arginine has been shown to be an essential substrate for optimal generation of LAK cells. Supplemental dietary L-arginine also appears to enhance cytotoxic mechanisms of lymphocytes and to potentiate IL2 immunotherapy. </p>
<p>The use of anti-CD3 antibodies, which are capable also of activating T-cells, in combination with IL2 increases the yields of LAK cells by a factor of 10-1000 over that achieved by IL2 alone. It has been observed that CIK (cytokine induced killer cells) can be generated by use of anti-CD3 antibodies and various cytokines, which are even more cytotoxic than LAK cells. </p>
<p>Factors such as TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and also IL1 can be employed with lower doses of IL2 to generate LAK cells, which are as cytolytic as those obtained by high doses of IL2. The treatment of peripheral lymphocytes and monocytes with IL7 has been shown to stimulate endogenous production of IL2. In addition, IL7 also promotes the CD4(+)-T-cell dependent destruction of tumor cells and appears to induce significant LAK cell activity, either alone or in combination with IL2. IL12 has been observed also to be of importance. It facilitates both non-specific LAK cell activities and specific responses of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and is capable of reducing the amounts of IL2 required for LAK cell generation in vitro. The combination of IL4 and IL12 results in a synergistic proliferative activity (8-fold) in CD56(+) natural killer cells and a marked increase in the cell yields. </p>
<p>LAK cells may play an important role in regulation of monocytes, which are important accessory cells in the activation of T-cells for specific antigen recognition. IL2 can induce LAK cells to downregulate antigen presentation function in monocytes activated by GM-CSF and IL3) but not by IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Several inhibitors of LAK cell activity may play an important role also in limiting the therapeutic efficacy of IL2 and/or LAK cells. in vitro, IL4, TGF-beta, steroids, and also prostaglandin E2, known to stimulate adenylate cyclase, interfere with the generation of LAK cells if added during the activation period. In vivo the activity of LAK cells is inhibited by steroids and suppressor cells. Peripheral blood neutrophils inhibit the cytolytic efficiency of IL2 activated LAK cells in a dose-dependent manner although the conditioned medium of cultured neutrophils does not contain soluble factors eliciting this response. Tumors may produce factors also which inhibit cytokine secretion from LAK cells or may develop other means of escaping the cytolytic activities of LAK cells. It has been observed, for example, that for some unknown reasons natural killer cells of many patients with advanced solid tumors are defective in their ability to respond by proliferation to IL2 even in the presence of exogenously supplied growth factors. In addition, fibrin deposition around tumor and/or effector cells can protect tumor cells from immune destruction also and diminish the efficiency of the cytotoxic LAK/NK-cells. The resistance of some tumor cell types against adoptive immunotherapy appears to be due, at least in part, by the ability of IL2 itself to protect tumor cells expressing the IL2 receptor against LAK activity by an as yet unknown mechanism. </p>
<p>The generation of LAK cells for re-infusion into tumor patients is an exacting and cumbersome task. It has been shown recently that LAK cell activity can be generated also in vivo following, for example, the subcutaneous administration of low doses of IL2 as an alternative to conventional systemic treatment involving continuous intravenous infusion of (highly toxic) high doses of IL2. NK-cell activity appears to be maintained for approximately 6 months after discontinuation of IL2 administration. </p>
<p>For some types of tumors, for example, advanced renal cell carcinoma, a review of cases shows that the use of LAK cells does not lead to higher response rates or to prolonged response duration, progression-free survival or survival. Adoptive transfer of in vitro-generated LAK cells therefore is not necessarily required for the antineoplastic activities of IL2 and an increased efficacy of the IL2 treatment. For a novel approach in cancer therapy involving the use of genetically engineered cells see: Cytokine gene transfer. </p>

<h2>eosinophils</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Eosinophils are a type of granulocytes (eosinophilic granulocytes or eosinophilic leukocytes) that comprise only 2-4 % of the blood leukocytes. Eosinophils are found in high numbers in intestinal and pulmonary mucosae and in the dermis of the skin. Eosinophils contain brightly eosinophilic granules (so named because they have an affinity for eosin) that partially obscure the bilobed nucleus. The matrix of the granules contains lysosomal enzymes and in particular has a high content of peroxidase, arylsulfatase, acid phosphatase, RNase and cathepsin. Eosinophils also contain preformed stores of diverse cytokines and chemokines within their cytoplasmic granules (Lacy and Moqbel, 2000), including, for example chemokines such as eotaxin (Nakajima et al, 1998) and RANTES (Lim et al, 1995; Ying et al, 1996; Lacy et al, 1999), and cytokines such as IL16 (Lim et al, 1996), IL4 (Moqbel et al, 1995, Bandeira-Melo et al, 2001), IL12 (Grewe et al, 1998). </p>
<p>Many factors induce degranulation of eosinophils (release of bioactive factors from eosinophilic granules). They also enhance a variety of cell functions. Cells having undergone this type of cell activation (often referred to as "cytokine priming") are recognized, among other things, by reduced granulation, vacuolization, an expansion of the cytoplasm, altered metabolism and cell surface expression of antigens. Such cells are identified as hypodense eosinophils (light density eosinophils) (specific gravity   Eosinophils are engaged particularly in phagocytosis of antigen-antibody complexes. Their numbers increase during certain parasitic infections and in individuals with allergies. Some contents of eosinophil granules react with products from basophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes (the enzyme histaminase, for example, inactivates histamine). The net effect of factors released by eosinophils is a general decrease in the inflammatory response and a reduction of granulocyte migration into sites of invasion by micro-organisms. Yousefi et al (2008) have reported an unusual feature of eosinophils reflecting upon their functions in innate immunity. Lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria activate eosinophils that have been primed with IL5 or IFN-gamma to release mitochondrial DNA in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner, but independent of eosinophil death. In the extracellular space, the mitochondrial DNA and the granule proteins form extracellular structures able to bind and kill bacteria both in vitro and under inflammatory conditions in vivo. After cecal ligation and puncture, transgenic mice expressing IL5, but not wild-type mice, show intestinal eosinophil infiltration and extracellular DNA deposition in association with protection against microbial sepsis.  Eosinophils have the capacity to secrete a plethora of cytokines, growth factors, and other mediators, which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Some mediators are produced constitutively, others are produced only after cell activation. In addition, they express numerous receptors allowing them to respond to cytokines (Shakoory et al, 2004). Vast differences may exist between eosinophils isolated from different anatomical sites (airway, blood), and species differences have been observed also. Eosinophils have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species.

<h2>basophils</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Basophils are a type of bone marrow-derived granulocytes (basophilic granulocytes) that comprise less than 1 % of the circulating leukocytes. The nuclei aqre less heterochromatic than those of other granulocytes and stains with basophilic dyes (see also: basophil cells). These cells contain large irregularly shaped specific granules that often obscure the multilobed nucleus. These specific granules are similar to granules of mast cells in that they contain histamine and a heparin-like compound. </p>
<p>Tissue basophils resemble mast cells although their biochemical and morphological features may differ, depending upon the kind of tissue they reside in. They are differentiated from blood basophils by the fact that they are often twice the size of blood basophils, and have irregular and frequently elongated spindle shapes with cytoplasmic extensions. </p>
<p>Basophils arise from CD34(+) progenitor cells found in cord blood, peripheral blood, and the bone marrow, in particular cells that are CD34(+), express the receptors for IL3 and IL5 and are considered eosinophil basophil progenitors (Boyce et al, 1995). Basophils complete their differentiation within the bone marrow, whereas precursors of mast cells leave the bone marrow and differentiate into mast cells after having invaded connective or mucosal tissues. </p>
<p>Basophils have long been regarded as circulating mast cells and share a number of characteristics with eosinophils but blood basophils and mast cells are distinct hematopoietic cells (Falcone et al, 2000). Mature basophils can be distinguished phenotypically from mast cells. Basophils express the alpha chain of the IL3 receptor, which is not expressed by mast cells. Mast cells erxpress the kit receptor (SCF receptor, which is not expressed, or only weakly, on mature basophils). </p>
<p>Basophils play an important role in inflammatory reactions and as multifunctional effector cells in IgE-mediated reactions and are recruited rapidly to various organs sites during allergic late phase reactions (Charlesworth et al, 1989; Liu et al, 1991; Bascom et al, 1988). They have been identified as antigen-capturing cells that may function as important regulators of humoral immune responses. </p>
<p>Basophils release a plethora of potent inflammatory mediators from their cytoplasmic granules upon appropriate stimulation. This process is called degranulation. Degranulation can be caused by a wide range of signals, including high temperature, mechanical trauma, ionizing, toxins, venoms, proteases, tissue proteases, cationic proteins derived from eosinophils and neutrophils, IgE-dependent mechanisms, or IgE-independent immune mechanisms, for example through complement factors. Low molecular weight mediators include histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes. It is the contents of basophil granules released in response to the presence of allergens that cause increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle spasm, vasodilation, and the clinical symptoms of an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Many different factors are involved in the regulation of functional activities of basophils and influence their adhesion properties, migration, localization, proliferation, and phenotype. </p>
<p>For related information of interest see also: Cell types, Cell lines in Cytokine Research, Cell culture. For other entries pertaining to hematopoiesis see also the Hematology Dictionary section of this encyclopedia.  Basophils have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>leukocytes</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>a general collective term for some cell types of the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis). Leukocytes are those cells that do not produce hemoglobin (white blood cells). Normal human blood contains 4000 - 10,000 leukocytes/mL. </p>
<p>Individual types of leukocytes are differentiated from each other by morphology and behaviour towards histochemical stains. Leukocytes are generally divided into granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear cells) and agranulocytes (monomorphonuclear leukocytes, mononuclear cells). Granulocytes comprise basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Agranulocytes comprise monocytes and macrophages and lymphocytes (B-cells and T-cells). For a collective term see also: wandering cells. </p>
<p>40 - 75 % of blood leukocytes are neutrophils, 1 - 6 % are eosinophils, 2 - 10 % are monocytes, 20 - 45 % are lymphocytes, less than 1% are basophils. A subpopulation of leukocytes expressing markers of dendritic cells and endothelial cells, has been described as vascular leukocytes. </p>
<p>Some of the cellular contents may be shed by microvesiculation in the form of microparticles. </p>

<h2>T-helper</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Helper T-cells are special subpopulations of CD4(+) T-cells that provide help to other cells of the immune system in mounting immune responses by causing cell activation or the secretion of cytokines. These cells are neither phagocytic nor cytotoxic. They are collectively being referred to also as effector T-cells or T-effector cells (abbr. also Teff cells). </p>
<p>Several distinct types of T-helper cells, designated Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Th3 cells, have been identified. These cells have different functions in immunity (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989). For specific subtypes characterized and named after the production of one major cytokine see also: Th5 cells, Th6 cells, Th9 cells, Th17 cells, Th22 cells. </p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of different T-helper cell types from common precursors are still not completely known. Thp cells (p for precursor) are believed to be the precursor cells of Th0 cells. Th0 cells are believed to be precursor cells that develop into either Th1 cells or Th2 cells. Th0 cells can shift toward Th1 or Th2 in response to cytokines (Gajewski et al, 1994). Th0 cells can produce all cytokines found to be secreted into the conditioned medium of either Th1 cells or Th2 cells at low levels. NKT-cells show a Th0 pattern of cytokine secretion in that they secrete Th1 cytokines and Th2 cytokines even without stimulation. Cytokines and a number of costimulatory proteins (B7, for example) are known to have roles in the regulation of differentiation of T-helper cells into the different subtypes and to influence ratios of Th1 cells and Th2 cells. </p>
<p>Th1 cells (Mosmann et al, 1986; Cherwinsky et al, 1987; Mosmann and Coffman, 1989) stimulate strong cellular immunity but only weak and transient antibody responses. In general, Th1 cell responses are stimulated by intracellular pathogens (viruses, some mycobacteria, some yeasts, and some parasitic protozoans). These cells produce a number of cytokines known as Th1 cytokines or Type 1 cytokines and including IL2, IFN-gamma, IL12 and TNF-beta. </p>
<p>Th2 cells (Mosmann et al, 1986; Cherwinsky et al, 1987; Mosmann and Coffman, 1989) evoke especially strong antibody responses but relatively weak cellular activity. Th2 cell responses are usually elicited by free-living bacteria and other parasites. Th2 cells produce cytokines that are known as Th2 cytokines or Type 2 cytokines and include IL4, IL5, IL6, IL10, and IL13. </p>
<p>Distinct subpopulations of T-helper cells similar to those first identified by Mosmann et al (1986) in mice are found also in humans. However, the human subpopulations are not identical and display a less restricted cytokine profile in that the synthesis of IL2, IL6, and IL10 is not stringently restricted to a single subset (Del-Prete et al, 1991). It should be noted also that T-cells expressing both Type 1 cytokines and Type 2 cytokines have been identified during differentiation (Firestein et al, 1989; Kamogawa et al, 1993) and among terminally differentiated cells (Paliard et al, 1988), demonstrating that expression of these distinct cytokines profiles is not mutually exclusive. </p>
<p>Th3 cells are CD4(+) regulatory T-cells associated with immune mechanisms involving oral tolerance towards antigens (Groux et al, 1997; Weiner et al, 2001). These cells are characterised, among other things, by the secretion of TGF-beta and/or IL10. They have suppressive properties for Th1 cells and Th2 cells. Tr1 cells (T-regulatory 1 cells; see: regulatory T-cells) are similar to Th3 cells, but they secrete large amounts of IL10 and were first characterized on the basis of their role in preventing autoimmune colitis (Levings and Roncarolo, 2000; Groux et al, 1997). A unique subpopulation of T-helper cells are Th17 cells, which are characterized by the expression of IL17. </p>
<p>Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, secrete IL2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-beta, whereas Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells, express IL4, IL5, IL6, and IL10. Murine Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells, also express P600, the human counterpart of which has been identified as IL13. A novel cytokine inducing the synthesis of IFN-gamma in Th1 cells has been identified recently as IGIF (and renamed IL18 (see also: Interleukins). </p>
<p>The fact that some of these cytokines have been designated type 1 or type 2 factors does not imply that these cytokines cannot be produced also by other cells. Producer cells other than T-cells expressing CD4 include CD8(+) T-cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, B-cells, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and other cells. This is why many immunologists define immune responses by the types of cytokines controlling these responses rather than by the types of cells. Also, the actions of Th1 cells and Th2 cells in humans are not as clear-cut as they are in the mouse, where these cells are the primary sources of the cytokines. </p>
<p>Both types of T-helper cells can influence and regulate each other by the cytokines they secrete. For example, IFN-gamma, secreted by Th1 cells, can inhibit the proliferation of Th2 cells. IL10, secreted by Th2 cells, can suppress Th1 functions by inhibiting cytokine production (see also: CSIF, cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor). The Th2 cytokine IL4 inhibits the differentiation and/or expansion of Th1 cells. It thus appears that these functional subsets of helper cells are mutually antagonistic such that the decision of which subset predominates within an infection may determine also its outcome. Through the activities of the cytokines produced, Th1 cells and Th2 cells can keep each other in check and prevent inflammatory reactions in response to pathogens getting out of control. However, imbalances may also precipitate inappropriate reactions. It is thought that some autoimmune disorders may involve overactive Th1 cells while the exacerbation of other conditions such as allergies may involve overactive Th2 cell responses. </p>
<p>Th1 cells and Th2 lymphocytes also express a different repertoire of receptors for chemokines (Bonecchi et al, 1998). Human Th1 cells preferentially express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5, whereas Th2 cells display mostly CCR4 and some CCR3. The agonists for CXCR3, mig, I-TAC, and IP-10, have been shown to act as antagonists for the chemokine receptor CCR3 (Loetscher et al, 2001). I-TAC, mig, and IP10 compete for the binding of eotaxin to cells expressing CCR3 and inhibit migration and calcium ion changes induced in such cells by stimulation with eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES. Chemokines that attract Th1 cells by acting through the CXCR3 receptor may enhance the polarization of T-cell recruitment and tissue homing by blocking concomitantly the migration of Th2 cells in response to CCR3 ligands. </p>
<p>The term follicular B helper T-cells (also: follicular Th cells, follicular helper T-cells; follicular B-helper memory T-cells abbr. TFH cells) has been suggested for a subpopulation of T-helper cells that specifically localize to follicles (Breitfeld et al, 2000; Schaerli et al, 2000). These cells regulate the step-wise development of antigen-specific B cell immunity in vivo (Fazilleau et al, 2009). In peripheral blood these cells coexpress CD45R0 and the T-cell homing chemokine receptor CCR7. In secondary lymphoid organs, CD4(+) cells expressing CXCR5 lose expression of CCR7, which allows them to localize to B-cell follicles and germinal centers where they express high levels of CD40 ligand and ICOS. CD4(+) CD45R0(+) tonsillar T-cells expressing CXCR5 efficiently support the production of IgA and IgG. Analysis of the memory response reveals that long-lasting memory cells are found within the CD4(+) CD45R0(+) population expressing CXCR5. Bryant et al (2007) have reported that IL21 produced by follicular B helper T-cells potently stimulates the differentiation of B-cells into antibody-forming cells through the IL21 receptor. The generation of follicular B helper T-cells is closely associated with initiation of adaptive immunity and these cells thus play a central role in normal and pathological immune responses (Vinuesa et al, 2005; Moser and Ebert, 2003; Schaerli et al, 2001; King et al, 2008). For distinct other subsets of helper T-cells see also: Th5 cells, Th9 cells, Th17 cells, Th22 cells. </p>

<h2>monocytes</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Monocytes are essentially immature macrophages. After their formation and release by the bone marrow, these cells enter the bloodstream and circulate for about 36 hours while they mature into macrophages. Sessile macrophages are the tissue counterparts of monocytes of peripheral blood. Sometimes, the term histiocytes is used for these cells. Monocytes together with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) are being referred to collectively as myelomonocytic cells. The term plasmacytoid monocytes refers to a population of cells known also as T-associated plasma cells, plasmacytoid T-cells, plasmacytoid predendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or natural IFN-producing cells. See also: dendritic cells. </p>
<p> The frequently used terms inflammatory monocytes or pro-inflammatory monocytes refer to one subset of monocytes with high level expression of Ly6C, high levels of the chemokine receptor CCR2, and low levels of CX3CR1. The term inflammatory monocytes reflects the observation that cells belonging to this subset preferentially migrate to sites of inflammation (Geissmann et al, 2003). This monocyte subset corresponds to CD14(++) CD16(-) monocytes in humans and is being referred to also as classical monocytes (Belge et al, 2002) (as opposed to nonclassical monocytes, which, however, may also be inflammatory monocytes) (Strauss-Ayali et al, 2007). Use of these terms is not recommended (Ziegler-Heitbrock et al, 2010), because the label inflammatory has been used for different subpopulations in humans and mice. It has been pointed out also that these terms may prematurely ascribe functional attributes to cells based on ex vivo studies while they largely remain to be functionally characterized in vivo. Burke et al (2008) have reported that murine CD43(+) monocytes exhibit features of pro-inflammatory monocytes and are functionally homologeous to the human CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes. </p>
<p>Human monocytes can be subdivided into 3 subsets on the basis of the expression of CD14 and CD16 (Strauss-Ayali et al, 2007; Ziegler-Heitbrock et al, 2010). Monocytes with high CD14 expression but no CD16 expression are being referred to as classical monocytes (CD14(high) CD16(-) monocytes). The corresponding subset of mouse monocytes is Ly6C(++) CD43(+) monocytes (Ly6C(high) CD43(+) monocytes).  </p>
<p>Intermediate monocytes are those showing a high level of CD14 together with low levels of CD16 (CD14(high) CD16(+) monocytes). The corresponding subset of mouse monocytes is Ly6C(++) CD43(++) monocytes (Ly6C(high) CD43(high) monocytes).  </p>
<p>Nonclassical monocytes express a low level of CD14 together with high CD16 (CD14(+) CD16(high) monocytes). Without further characterization, CD16(+) monocytes, therefore may comprise intermediate monocytes and nonclassical monocytes. The corresponding subset of mouse monocytes is Ly6C(+) CD43(++) monocytes (Ly6C(+) CD43(high) monocytes).  </p>
<p>Expression data for all three subsets show a close relationship between intermediate monocytes and nonclassic monocytes but also distinct features that separate these two populations from one another (Wong et al, 2011). Expression information about intermediate monocytes has been reported also by Zawada et al (2011).  </p>
<p> Venneri et al (2007) have identified a distinct subpopulation of murine monocytes, which they have designated TEM [TIE2-expressing monocytes]. These cells appear to have a non-redundant function in promoting tumor angiogenesis and growth in mouse models (De Palma and Naldini, 2009). These cells are characterized by the expression of the TIE-2 angiopoietin receptor and required for the vascularization and growth of several tumor models. TIE-2 expression in human blood identifies a subset of monocytes distinct from classical inflammatory monocytes and comprised within the less abundant "resident" population. These cells account for 2-7 % of blood mononuclear cells in healthy donors and are distinct from rare circulating endothelial cells and progenitors. In human cancer patients, these cells are found in the blood and also within tumors, where they represent the main monocyte population distinct from tumor-associated macrophages. These cells are hardly detected in non-neoplastic tissues. In vitro, TEMs migrate towards the TIE-2 ligand angiopoietin-2. Release of angiopoietin-2 from activated endothelial cells and angiogenic vessels may thus be responsible for the preferential accumulation of these cells within tumors. Purified human TEMs, but not TEM-depleted monocytes, markedly promote angiogenesis in xenotransplanted human tumors, suggesting a role of these cells in human cancer progression. </p>
<p>Medbury et al (2008) have reported that monocytes can transform into fibrocytes. Thus, monocytes may play a more crucial role in the clinical outcome of atherosclerosis than previously realized as they not only contribute directly to plaque instability (through foam cell formation), but also promote plaque stability by transformation into a fibrocyte. </p>
<p> Monocytes have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species.

<h2>neutrophils</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>These cells are known also as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (abbr. PMN) (which also contains minor populations of other cell types) or neutrophilic granulocytes or neutrophilic leukocytes. The avian counterparts are being referred to as heterophils. </p>
<p>Neutrophils develop in a complex series of developmental stages (granulopoiesis) from precursor cells (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, Band cells). The precursor cells themselves develop from progenitor cells (CFU-GM, CFU-G), and these are derived from myeloid stem cells. Segmented neutrophils (neutrophilic segmented granulocytes or simply segmented cells, segmented granulocytes) are identified by a nucleus that is divided into definite lobes joined by filaments. These cells are the morphologically most mature cell of the myelocytic series. They are mature and fully functional neutrophils, capable of active motility, able to respond to chemotaxis, and capable of performing phagocytosis. Band cells (neutrophilic stab granulocytes, band neutrophils, band forms, stab cells) represent neutrophils that have just been released from the bone marrow. The name derives from a band-shaped or horseshoe-shaped nucleus frequently observed in these cells. Band cells are almost mature neutrophils and possesses full motility, active adhesion properties and some phagocytic abilities. </p>
<p>For subpopulations anti-tumorigenic and pro-tumorigenic neutrophils see also: tumor-associated neutrophils.  </p>
<p>Neutrophils are the most numerous leukocytes in the peripheral blood (60-70 % of leukocyte counts). They possess a multilobed nucleus and a salmon pink cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic granules are near the limit of resolution of the light microscope. Neutrophils are a critical component of human innate host defense. Leukocytosis, the increased release of these cells from the bone marrow, is a reliable diagnostic marker for infection and other inflammatory processes occurring in the absence of an infection. </p>
<p>Neutrophils are actively engaged in phagocytosis. Neutrophils rapidly accumulate at a site of infection and are instrumental in providing a host defense against most invading micro-organisms. Cells that have ingested micro-organisms are thought to be removed by programmed cell death (apoptosis), which most likely also prevents damage to healthy tissues and may be critical for the resolution of inflammation caused by cell activation of neutrophils (Savill, 1997; Savill et al, 1989; Kobayashi et al, 2002, 2003). </p>
<p>Mature circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils have a relatively short life-span of 8-12 hours. The pool of circulating cells is constantly renewed from the bone marrow. The life-span of these cells can be prolonged in response to various cytokines and they may persist in infected tissues or under conditions of inflammation and acquire additional functions, e. g., of dendritic-like cells. Thus, polymorphonuclear neutrophils are not truly terminally differentiated cells (Galligan and Yoshimura, 2003). </p>
<p>The cytoplasm of neutrophils contains two major types of granules (Borregaard and Cowland, 1997). The most numerous type are specific granules (secondary granules) which, among other things, contain collagenase, lactoferrin, bacteriocidal phagocytins, and lysozyme. Azurophilic granules (primary granules), so named because they stain with methylene azure, are less numerous and larger. They are most commonly found in granulocyte precursors (promyelocytes) and are not specific for neutrophils. These granules represent primary lysosomes, which contain myeloperoxidase, acid hydrolases characteristic of lysosomes, and also granulocyte elastase and unglycosylated forms of defensins. Granule contents are released in a controlled manner as a consequence of cell activation in a process called degranulation (Galligan and Yoshimura, 2003; Theilgaard-Mnch et al, 2005). </p>
<p>Neutrophils have the capacity to express (for reviews of granule contents and global expression profiles under various circumstances see also: Borregaard and Cowland, 1997; Faurschou and Borregaard, 2003; Subrahmanyam et al, 2001; Fessler et al, 2002; Malcolm et al, 2003; Kobayashi et al, 2002; Theilgaard-Mnch et al, 2004; Borregaard and Cowland, 1997; O'Neill et al, 2004; Kobayashi et al, 2004; Zhang et al, 2004; Tsukahara et al, 2003; Bussiere et al, 2002). </p>
<p> Neutrophils have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>
<p>The meaning of ¥ and ¥¥ is as follows: ¥ factor/protein is expressed; ¥¥ receptor (or, in some instances, binding sites) for this factor/protein is expressed. For further explanations concerning format, "hidden" information, and/or ambiguities see my remarks in the entry cell types. </p>

<h2>macrophages</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>abbr. in texts frequently: Mphi. </p>
<p>Macrophages are cells derived from bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (bone marrow-derived macrophages, abbr. BMM; monocyte-derived macrophages, abbr. MDM) (Gordon and Taylor, 2005) that circulate in the blood or have homed in to tissues in the steady state or in response to inflammation. The myeloid progenitor cell in the bone marrow that gives rise to circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells also is the precursor of many different cell types such as neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells (see also: hematopoiesis). </p>
<p>The differentiation of macrophages from unipotential progenitor cells and bipotential progenitor cells in the bone marrow is controlled by a variety of cytokines. Hashimoto et al (1999) have reported the analysis of gene expression during this process and describe 35,037 different transcripts expressed in human blood monocytes and macrophages induced by GM-CSF or M-CSF. </p>
<p>Blood monocytes, which can engage in pinocytic and phagocytic activities, migrate in response to various chemotactic factors, and express Fc-gamma receptors and iC3b complement, have been considered to be immature forms of tissue-resident macrophages but can be seen also as a population of circulating macrophages (see also: histiomonocytes). Further differentiation takes place in tissues and the resulting macrophage populations are being referred to as resident macrophages. </p>
<p>Leenen et al (1994) have reviewed a variety of immunological markers recognized by a selected panel of monoclonal antibodies that are characteristic of: macrophage precursors and immature macrophages (ER-MP12, ER-MP20, ER-MP54, ER-MP58), mature macrophages in general (F4/80, BM8, Mac-1, Mac-2, ER-BMDM1), macrophage subsets (ER-HR3, ER-MP23, ER-TR9, Forssman antigen, MOMA-1, MOMA-2, Monts-4, SER-4), and IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages (H-2Ia, LFA-1, ICAM-1, 158.2, MBR-2, TM-2, TM-4, and TM-5). </p>
<p>Normal macrophages (resident macrophages or tissue macrophages; sometimes also referred to as trophic macrophages) can be found in many tissues, including connective tissues, liver, lung, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, serous fluids, skin, and others (for resident macrophages in the heart see: Cardiac tissue macrophages; for specialized germinal center macrophages see: tingible body macrophages; for resident macrophages in adipose tissues see: adipose tissue macrophages (abbr. often ATMs)). Foam cells are lipid-laden macrophages, called also lipophages, associated with atherosclerotic plaques. Siderophages are iron-laden macrophages. Smoker cells are tissue macrophages found in the lungs of smokers. </p>
<p>Multinucleated giant cells are derived by fusion of macrophages. They have the capacity to function like macrophages in host defense against infection and are engaged in the removal of large foreign objects. </p>
<p>Local populations of macrophages are maintained by proliferation of resident progenitor cells and influx of monocytes from blood. Some types of macrophages have special names, depending on where they reside. Macrophages in connective tissue and the skin are often being referred to as histiocytes. One type of macrophages in the skin is known as Langerhans cells. Kupffers cells are macrophages in the liver sinusoids. Osteoclasts are macrophages in the bone. Macrophages in the brain are microglial cells. Placental macrophages are frequently being referred to as Hofbauer cells. Macrophage-like cells in the synovium of cells are synoviomacrophages (called also A-synoviocytes). The term neuronophages has been used for antigen-presenting cells of the brain that are capable of taking up dead neurons by phagocytosis. </p>
<p> Inflammatory macrophages are derived exclusively from monocytes, have similar properties, and are present in various exudates. Some types of macrophages, identified either bei expression of distinct surface markers or by discrete secretion products, may be associated with distinct disease states. </p>
<p> Macrophage populations have been shown to comprise distinct subpopulations that are being referred to generally as polarized macrophages. The term classically activated macrophages (abbr. sometimes CAMPhi; called also M1 macrophages; abbr. Mphi1) refers to macrophages having undergone cell activation in response to LPS or IFN-gamma. Classical M1 macrophages have a pro-inflammatory phenotype and are characterized by high expression of pro-inßammatory cytokines, iNOS expression, and production of reactive oxygen species (Gordon, 2003; Gordon S and Taylor PR, 2005; Martinez et al, 2008). More generally speaking, cell activation of macrophages by Th1 cytokines (which includes IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) is referred to as type 1 activation (Ma et al, 2003). The cytokines expressed by M1 macrophages such as IL1-beta, TNF-alpha, IL12, IL6 are being referred to sometimes as M1 cytokines. The term alternatively activated macrophages (abbr. sometimes AAMPhi or aaMF or AAMs; called also M2 macrophages; abbr. Mphi2) refers to macrophages having undergone cell activation in response to IL4 or glucocorticoids (Gordon, 2003; Martinez et al, 2008; Gordon and Martinez, 2010). These cells have an anti-inflammatory phenotype (for cells with an M2 phenotype see also: adipose tissue macrophages; for an imbalance between M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages involved in metabolic syndromes see also: metainflammation). More generally speaking, cell activation of macrophages by Th2 cytokines (which includes IL4 and IL13) is referred to as type 2 activation (Ma et al, 2003). Alternatively activated macrophages generated in vivo have a gene expression profile distinct from other macrophage populations (Loke et al, 2002). The cytokines expressed by M2 macrophages such as IL10, IL1ra, TGF-beta are being referred to sometimes as M2 cytokines. </p>
<p>M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages are thought to represent two extremes of a spectrum of macrophage activation states (Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Murray and Wynn, 2011; Gordon and Martinez, 2010). M1 macrophages are characterized by high expression of IL12 and IL23, and low expression of IL10 and generally have immunostimulatory properties oriented towards Th1 cell activation. They kill intracellular pathogens, and have antitumoral activity. M2 macrophages express love levels of IL12 and IL-23, and express high levels of IL10 and CD206 as well as scavenger receptors. M2 macrophages have poor antigen-presenting capacity, promote angiogenesis, tissue remodelling and repair; and suppress immunity involving Th1 cells. They support Th2 cell responses necessary for killing and encapsulation of parasites (Martinez FO et al, 2008; Martinez FO et al, 2009).  </p>
<p>Both types of activated cells can co-exist and show differences in their capacity to secrete mediators and to express receptors (see, for example, Kordelja et al, 1997; Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Martinez FO et al, 2006). Thus, these cells participate to different extents in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune reactions. Particle-mediated cell activation of macrophages also differs from type 1 or type activated cells in gene expression patterns (Ma et al, 2003). M2 macrophages express high levels of mannose receptor, dectin-1, and arginase. M2 subsets have been characterized (Gordon and Taylor, 2005) and include M2 macrophages activated by IL4 or IL13 (referred to also as M2a macrophages (Martinez et al, 2008), macrophages activated by immune complexes (referred to also as M2b macrophages), and macrophages polarized with glucocorticoids or IL10 (M2c macrophages) (Martinez et al, 2008). </p>
<p>The term macrophage deactivation refers to a reversal of the activated state. This process requires the presence of a variety of mediators. </p>
<p>M4 macrophages define a macrophage differentiation step that differs from M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages (Gleissner et al, 2010). M4 macrophages are induced by the chemokine CXCL4 derived from platelets, and their transcriptome differs markedly from the other two differentiation types. </p>
<p>The different types of macrophages constitute a heterogeneous population of cells that differ in their origin and differentiation stage and may have been subject to different tissue-specific micro-environmental influences. These cells thus can display a range of functional and morphological phenotypes (expression of membrane-bound and secretory products). Mosser and Edwards (2008) have reviewed the biology of different subpopulations of macrophages and have suggested a macrophage classification scheme based on the fundamental macrophage functions that are involved in maintaining homeostasis. Host defence macrophages correspond to M1 macrophages. In addition, a distinction is made between wound healing macrophages and regulatory macrophages engaged in immune regulation. Macrophages can evolve to exhibit characteristics that are shared by more than one macrophage population and probably constitute a spectrum of cell types with shared or specific activities. The term regulatory macrophages has been used to describe a population of macrophages that produces high levels of IL10 and low levels of IL12 and IL23. These macrophages also produce HB-EGF (Edwards et al, 2009). </p>
<p> CD4(+) CD8(+) macrophages have been shown to constitute a unique subpopulation of cytotoxic macrophages that kill tumor cells by mechanisms involving NKG2D receptors, granzymes and perforin (Baba et al, 2008).  Tumor-associated macrophages (abbr. TAM) are highly active resident immune effector cells found in the stroma of tumors. They may either positively or negatively regulate the growth of various malignant cells (see also: TIL [tumor infiltrating lymphocytes]) (Ohno et al, 2003; Mantovani et al, 2002; Sica et al, 2002). Resting TAMs have been shown to express the immunosuppressive cytokine IL10, phagocytosis-related receptors/molecules (Msr2 and C1q), inflammatory chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5) and chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL16), the expression of which is inducible by interferons. Cell activation of TAMs by lipopolysaccharides interferes with the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1-beta, IL6, TNF-alpha) and chemokines (CCL3), but upregulates the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL10, TGF-beta) and IFN inducible chemokines (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL16) (Biswas et al, 2006). Duff et al (2007) have reported gene expression patterns of TAMs, which reveal that these cells are distinct from both wound and peritoneal macrophages. </p>
<p>Resident macrophages retain some proliferative capacity, can engage in phagocytosis, can respond to various stimuli, but are otherwise relative quiescent with respect to immunological and secretory functions. </p>
<p>Macrophages participate in all phases of the immune response as phagocytic cells, and functionally distinct macrophage populations provide for very flexible immune responses. They play a key role in host defences against intracellular parasitic micro-organisms and tumor cells. Macrophages, through their secretory products, control inflammation, changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix, tissue reorganization, angiogenesis, and other processes. These cells can be cytotoxic for other cells (K cells) and can kill or damage extracellular targets by means of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Macrophages constitute an important link between the innate and adaptive immune systems through presentation of antigens to T-cells and production of cytokines and chemokines. The capacity of macrophages to participate in these and other processes by directly or indirectly influencing the bioactivities of other cells may depend on the developmental stage and also depends largely on cell activation. Tissue macrophages play a critical role in wound healing by producing chemoattractants recruiting and activating additional macrophages, growth factors promoting cellular proliferation, proteases and extracellular matrix molecules, and factors restraining tissue growth once repair is completed. For macrophages that antagonize immune responses see: suppressor macrophages. </p>
<p>Macrophages have the capacity to secrete a plethora of cytokines, growth factors, and other mediators (Nathan, 1987), which may be engaged in autocrine, paracrine or endocrine interactions that can affect many other cell types. Some mediators are produced constitutively, others are produced only after cell activation. The cells are said to have become 'stimulated', 'activated', 'induced', 'elicited', etc, and these terms are often used interchangeably. Frequently, any distinctions made to describe degrees of cell activation are more or less arbitrary. Depending in large part on the nature of the stimuli, macrophages may be primed only for selected functions and may not attain the full spectrum of functional capacities. Distinct subpopulations of macrophages or differently activated macrophages display various functions in immune reactions and this may be reflected by differences in the factors they produce, and the mediators they respond to, under various circumstances. </p>
<p>Numerous studies have been carried out to identify genes expressed or repressed specifically in macrophages in response to a variety of stimuli. Chaussabel et al (2003) have compared gene expression profiles in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages generated in vitro from the same individual blood donors and exposed to 5 different pathogens. These analyses demonstrate dendritic cells and macrophages constitutively express approximately 4000 genes, 96 % of which are shared between the 2 cell types. Unique expression patterns are found in response to each pathogen. Li et al (2004) have reported the results of a gene expression profiling study aimed at identifying genes expressed or repressed specifically in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Gene expression profiling of bovine macrophages in response to Escherichia coli O157:H7 lipopolysaccharide has been reported by Chitko-McKown et al (2004). Kohro et al (2004) have reported a comparison of the differences in gene expression profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages and THP-1 cells differentiated in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Rodriguez et al (2004) have compared gene expression patterns in macrophages after phagocytosis of Leishmania chagasi with those observed after treatment with lipopolysaccharides and IFN-gamma. Chaussabel et al (2003) have compared gene expression patterns in human macrophages and dendritic cells. In the absence of microbial stimulation, dendritic cells and macrophages constitutively express approximately 4000 genes, 96 % of which are shared between the 2 cell types. The genes altered transcriptionally in both cell types following pathogen exposure are largely cell specific. Ragno et al (2001) have reported changes in gene expression that occur in the human macrophage cell line, THP1 following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Gustafsson et al (2008) have used micro-arrays comprising approximately 14,000 genes and compare the gene expression patterns of human first trimester decidual CD14(+) monocytes / macrophages with the expression profile of the corresponding cells in blood. Guerfali et al (2008) have reported the gene expression profile of human macrophages infected with Leishmania major parasites. Edwards et al (2006) have reported expression profiles and gene signatures for M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and type 2 activation.  </p>
<p> Macrophages have been shown to possess the capacity to express the proteins listed below. Please note the following general observations, which practically apply to all cell types: expression may be influenced by tissue localization, may occur only in discrete subpopulations of cells, may vary between established cell lines, primary cells, embryonic cells, mature cells, fully differentiated cells, activated cells, non-activated cells or growth conditions (confluent vs. sparse cultures), may be influenced by various disease states (including cancer environment), and may differ between species. Note also: expression profile information lists entities only for which there is an entry in COPE or one of its subdictionaries. </p>

<h2>stromal%20cells</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The term stromal cells is a collective term for all the different supporting cell types found in a given tissue or organ as distinguished from the functional elements of this tissue or organ, the so-called parenchymal cells. Stroma, therefore, is a heterogeneous assortment of different cell types at any given time point, and its composition may also vary considerably over time. See also: stromal cell line. </p>
<p>Note: the term stromal cells is used frequently also to refer to mesenchymal stem cells (Vayssade and Nagel, 2009). In some instances the term interstitial cells is used synonymously with stromal cells.  </p>
