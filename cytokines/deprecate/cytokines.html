<h1>Cytokines</h1>

<h2>CCL11</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 11, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL11 is the new designation of Eotaxin. An older designation is SCYA11 [small inducible cytokine A11]. </p>

<h2>CCL2</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this particular group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>This factor is the same as GDCF, HC11, LDCF, MCAF, MCP, MCP-1, SMC-CF, TDCF, TSG-8. A previous designation is SCYA2 [small inducible cytokine A2]. </p>
<p>CCL2 has been shown to be cleaved by the metalloproteinase MMP-12. Cleavage produces a receptor antagonist (Dean et al, 2008). </p>

<h2>CCL4</h2>
<p>[CC chemokine ligand 4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4] This is the approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). Members of this group of so-called CC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CCL (L for ligand) followed by a number. </p>
<p>CCL4 is the new designation of ACT-2. This factor is identical with 744.1, G26, H400, HC21, LAG-1, MIP-1-beta, and SIS-gamma. A previous designation is SCYA4 [small inducible cytokine A4]. </p>
<p>The human genome contains two paralogous genes for the CCL4 chemokine, represented by ACT-2 and LAG-1. These genes are highly homologous, but encode slightly different proteins and also are regulated and expressed differentially. This also suggests that the two genes may not have identical activities. Monocytes express predominantly ACT-2. Peripheral blood B-lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and LAG-1 (Lu et al, 2004). </p>
<p>The protein is known mainly for its activity as a chemotactic cytokine but may have a potential role in host defense as a direct antiviral agent. CCL4 has been reported to show a significant direct antiviral activity against HSV-1. It binds to HSV-1 virions via envelope glycoprotein gB and is capable of generating pores in the envelope of HSV-1 (Nakayama et al, 2006). </p>

<h2>CXCL1</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL1 has been identified independently as CINC-2-beta, GRO1, GRO-alpha, KC, MGSA-alpha, MIP-2, NAP-3, N51, which are CXC-Chemokines.

<h2>CXCL10</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL10 has been identified independently as IP-10 [Interferon-inducible protein-10], known also as INP-10. The factor is identical with CRG-2, C7, Ifi10, mob-1. An older designation is SCYB10 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 10]. </p>
<p> Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL10 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. Cole et al (2001) have reported that CXCL10 possesses antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Proost et al (2003) have shown that CXCL10 produced by connective tissue fibroblasts attracts activated Th1 cells and natural killer cells expressing the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 to sites of infection, can also antagonize the CCR3 dependent attraction of Th2 lymphocytes, and exerts CXCR3-independent, defensin-like antibacterial activity. </p>
<p>Hensbergen et al (2004) have reported that native chemokine CXCL10 is processed in primary keratinocytes by furin to a shorter form that lacks four amino acids at the C-terminus. The truncated CXCL10 variant is a potent ligand for CXCR3 and retains its direct antibacterial activity. </p>
<p>Egesten et al (2007) have reported that CXCL10 possesses antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, a common agent causing streptococcal pharyngitis. This activity is neutralized by a bacterial virulence factor, SIC </p>
<p>Loos et al (2008) have shown that protein citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase of CXCL10 is a naturally occurring posttranslational modification. Citrullination reduces the chemoattracting and signaling capacity of CXCL10 for CXC-Chemokine receptor CXCR3 but does not affect receptor binding. The citrullinated chemokine remains active on T-cells but is weaker than authentic CXCL10. Deimination decreases heparin binding properties of CXCL10. </p>

<h2>CXCL12</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL12 has been identified independently as SDF [Stromal cell-derived factor]. The protein is identical with IRH, SDF-1-alpha (CXCL12-alpha), SDF-1-beta (CXCL12-beta), PBSF, TLSF-alpha, TLSF-beta, TPAR-1. An older designation is SCYB12 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 12]. </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL12. </p>
<p>Campana et al (2009) have shown that CXCL12 in the fluid phase binds to HMG-1 secreted from dendritic cells and macrophages. This binding protects CXCL12 conformation and function in a reducing environment and thus HMG-1 may contribute to the regulation of leukocyte recruitment and motility. </p>
<p>Nie et al (2008) have reported that the ligand of CXCR4, CXCL12, produced by bone marrow stromal cells is not only the major chemoattractant for hematopoietic stem cells but also a regulatory factor that controls the quiescence of primitive hematopoietic cells. CXCL12 inhibits entry of primitive hematopoietic cells into the cell cycle, and inactivation of its receptor, CXCR4, in hematopoietic stem cells causes excessive hematopoietic stem cells proliferation. The hyperproliferative hematopoietic stem cells are able to maintain a stable stem cell compartment and sustain hematopoiesis. </p>
<p>Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL12 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphyllococcus aureus) bacteria. </p>

<h2>CXCL9</h2>
<p>approved gene symbol for a member of a group of cytokines generally known as chemokines. Members of this group of so-called CXC-Chemokines belong to the SCY family of cytokines and are designated CXCL (L for ligand) followed by a number (Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000). </p>
<p>CXCL9 has been identified independently as mig [monokine induced by gamma-Interferon] and is known also as CRG-10. An older designation is SCYB9 [small inducible cytokine subfamily B member 9]. </p>
<p>Mller et al (2001) have described the development of multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets for the simultaneous analysis of several chemokines, including CXCL9. </p>
<p> Yang et al (2003) have shown that CXCL9 is active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Cole et al (2001) have reported that CXCL9 possesses antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Egesten et al (2007) have reported that CXCL9 possesses antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, which is neutralized by a bacterial virulence factor, SIC. Tonsil fluid from patients with streptococcal pharyngitis contains high amounts of this chemokine. In vitro, inflamed pharyngeal epithelium produce large amounts of CXCL9 in the presence of bacteria. CXCL9 is degraded by speB of Streptococcus pyogenes but, unlike other chemokines, retains its antibacterial activity and thus appears to be a major antibacterial factor in inflammed epithelium (Egesten et al, 2009). </p>
<p>The chemokine is detected also in seminal plasma of fertile donors. Significantly lower levels of CXCL9 are found in in vasectomized donors (Linge et al, 2008). CXCL9 from seminal plasma possesses antibacterial activity against the urogenital pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. </p>

<h2>FGF2</h2>

<h2>HGF</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-1-) hematopoietic growth factors. See: Hematopoietins. </p>
<p> Copyright © 2012 by H IBELGAUFTS. All rights reserved. ENTRY COMPLETED. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-2-) hepatocyte growth factor </p>
<p>This factor is isolated from bovine liver (Ueono et al, 1986). It is mitogenic for hepatocytes. This factor is identical with bFGF and is not identical with HGF = scatter factor (entry -3-). </p>
<p> Copyright © 2012 by H IBELGAUFTS. All rights reserved. ENTRY COMPLETED. </p>
<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-3-) hepatocyte growth factor </p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>F-TCF (fibroblast tumor cytotoxic factor); HL-60-HGF; HPTA (Hepatopoietin A); SF (scatter factor); TCF (tumor cytotoxic factor). The factor is referred to now frequently as HGF/SF (for Hepatocyte growth factor-scatter factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p>SOURCES </p>
<p>HGF was isolated initially from the serum of partially hepatectomised rats. It is produced predominantly in the liver and the pancreas. The liver cells mainly responsible for the synthesis of HGF are Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells. </p>
<p>The synthesis of HGF is stimulated in particular by injuries affecting liver tissues (hepatitis, ischemia, hepatectomy) (see also: inflammation, wound healing). In liver cells the expression of the HGF gene can be repressed strongly by TGF-beta. In human skin fibroblasts the synthesis of HGF is induced by both molecular forms of IL1. </p>
<p>HGF can be isolated also from platelets, kidney, and human serum. HGF is expressed also in human placenta and is found predominantly in trophoblastic tumors. HGF is synthesized also by the HL-60 cell line. </p>
<p>PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>HGF consists of two subunits held by a disulfide bond. The alpha subunit (69 kDa) has a length of 440 amino acids. The beta subunit (34 kDa) has a length of 234 amino acids. The beta chain of the factor shows approximately 38 % homology at the protein level to the serine protease domain of plasminogen. A variant of the beta chain has been shown to function as a subunit of a hybrid cytokine known as PPBSF [pre-pro-B-cell growth stimulating factor]. </p>
<p>HGF is a glycoprotein; the non-glycosylated factor is also bioactive. The beta-chain of the murine and rat factor display approximately 95 % sequence identity. The murine beta-chain also shows approximately 70 % sequence identity with rabbit HPTA (hepatopoietin A). </p>
<p>Miau et al (1996) have reported the identification and characterization of a novel variant HGF lacking the beta chain from the conditioned medium of stromal cells derived from mouse spleen. Compared to human HGF, it has much lower heparin binding activity. </p>
<p>Lung fibroblast-derived mitogen is a variant of HGF that is mitogenic for epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and melanocytes. </p>
<p>A variant of HGF is obtained by alternative splicing. This variant, designated HGF/NK2, is no longer mitogenic and inhibits the HGF induced proliferation of cells. This demonstrates that one and the same gene encodes a growth factor and a natural specific antagonist. The HGF/NK1 isoform, which is shorter than HGF/NK2, possesses modest mitogenic and scattering activity. It possesses partial agonist/antagonist properties. For another truncated form that acts as a specific inhibitor of HGF actions see: HGF/NK4. </p>
<p>dHGF is a naturally occurring splice variant of HGF that lacks a sequence of 5 amino acids in the first kringle domain. The deletion significantly alters the biological activities, solubility, and immunological property of HGF. HGF is more potent than dHGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human aorta smooth muscle cells, and the murine myeloblastic cell line NSF-60. dHGF is more potent than HGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in LLC-PK1 (pig kidney epithelial cells), OK (American opossum kidney epithelial cells), and rat hepatocytes (Shima et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Bell et al (1999) have generated transgenic mice expressing dHGF in the liver under control of the albumin promoter. These mice develop normally, have an enhanced rate of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, and exhibit a threefold higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma beyond 17 months of age. Overexpression of dHGF dramatically accelerates diethyl-nitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis. These tumors arise faster, are significantly larger, more numerous and more invasive than those appearing in non-transgenic littermates. Liver tumors and cultured tumor cell lines from dHGF transgenics express high levels of HGF and its receptor c-met. </p>
<p>Both subunits of HGF are obtained by endoproteolytic cleavage of a common preproprotein of 728 amino acids (approximately 90 kDa) which itself is biologically inactive. The inactive precursor is mostly found in a matrix-associated form. Maturation of the precursor into the active heterodimer takes place in the extracellular environment and results from proteolytic cleavage by urokinase which thus acts as a HGF convertase. </p>
<p>The inactive single-chain precursor of HGF secreted by the producing cells is converted to a biologically active heterodimer by a serine protease, the activity of which is induced in injured liver tissue. A serum serine protease that activates single-chain HGF has been identified (see: HGFA). </p>
<p>An inhibitor of HGF activator (Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1; abbr. HAI-1) has been isolated by Shimomura et al (1997) from the conditioned medium of the human MKN45 stomach carcinoma cell line. The sequence of the cDNA suggests that the inhibitor is a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. A second inhibitor (Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2; abbr. HAI-2) has been isolated from the same cell line by Kawaguchi et al (1997). HAI-2 is derived from a precursor protein of 252 amino acids and 2 is also a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. Both inhibitors are produced in a membrane-associated form and secreted in a proteolytically truncated form. </p>
<p>GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The HGF gene has a length of approximately 70 kb and contains 18 exons. It encodes an mRNA of 6.3 kb. The human gene maps to chromosome 7q11.2-21.1. An IL6 responsive element (see also: gene expression) and a binding site for an IL6-specific transcription factor, C/EBP-beta (see also: IL6) lies in close proximity to the transcription initiation site of the HGF gene. </p>
<p>The murine HGF gene contains a variety of different putative regulatory elements, including four copies of the IL6 responsive element (IL6RE), two potential binding sites for C/EBP-beta, a TGF-beta-1 inhibitory element (TIE element), a cAMP response element (CRE), two estrogen response elements (ERE), a potential vitamin D response element (VDRE) overlapping with a chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) transcription factor binding element, two liver-specific transcription factor (C/EBP) binding sites, and a B-cell and macrophage-specific transcriptional factor binding site (PU.1/ETS). </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The HGF receptor is encoded by the met proto-oncogene on human chromosome 7p11-4. This gene encodes a protein with intrinsic tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in its intracellular domain. The heavy chain is thought to play an important role in the interaction of HGF with its receptor and the light chain is further required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. </p>
<p>The phosphorylated receptor binds phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase which is responsible for post receptor signaling. </p>
<p>Alternative splicing leads to the formation of various isoforms of the receptor. It has been suggested that these isoforms are biologically active and may mediate different biologically responses. The existence of further non-met receptors for HGF has been suggested also. </p>
<p>Ohnishi et al (2012) have reported that the beta chain of HGF utilizes CD206 expressed on Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells as a receptor. Binding of HGF beta chain, to CD206 enhances the ingestion of latex beads, or of apoptotic neutrophils, suggesting that this complex may provide a new pathway for the enhancement of cell clearance systems, which is associated with resolution of inflammation.  </p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of HGF are not species-specific. </p>
<p>HGF is a hepatotrophic factor that stimulates the proliferation of hepatocytes in vivo. HGF is the most potent known mitogen for hepatocytes in primary culture. It is one of the major mitogens engaged in liver regeneration processes following partial hepatectomy and other liver injuries (see also: inflammation, wound healing). HGF has been shown also to be involved in the regeneration of kidney tubules. It is a mitogen for kidney epithelial cells. In vitro HGF induces endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate (see also: Scatter factor). </p>
<p>HGF and EGF activities are additive. The mitogenic effect of HGF is enhanced by norepinephine. The biological activity of HGF can be inhibited by suramin. HGF abolishes the inhibitory actions of TGF-beta on cellular proliferation. HGF has been shown also to be one of the priming factors for neutrophils (see also: cell activation). </p>
<p>At present HGF is the only known factor influencing the three-dimensional growth of cells in three-dimensional collagen gels where it leads to the formation of tubular structures in growing epithelial cells. HGF is therefore a multifunctional cytokine that acts as a mitogen, a motogen (see: Scatter factor) and a morphogen, explaining its functions in organogenesis and tissue regeneration. </p>
<p>HGF also shows paracrine activities in that it is produced by kidney mesangial cells and acts on renal epithelial cells. HGF also stimulates the growth of human melanoma cells and murine keratinocytes. The growth of some hepatocellular carcinomas and some human tumor cell lines (B6/F1 melanoma, KB-cells) is inhibited by HGF. </p>
<p>In the rabbit cornea, highly purified HGF promotes neovascularization at subnanomolar concentrations. </p>
<p>HGF synergizes with IL3 and GM-CSF to stimulate colony formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro and may, therefore, also modulate hematopoiesis. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of HGF have been studied in transgenic mice expressing the factor under the control of albumin regulatory sequences. Hepatocytes of HGF-transgenic mice express increased levels of HGF as an autocrine growth modulator. The experiments also show that HGF increases growth and repair processes when expressed for long periods in the liver: the livers of HGF-transgenic mice recover completely in half the time needed for their normal siblings after partial hepatectomy. Levels of cellular myc and jun mRNA were increased in HGF-transgenic mice. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>A sensitive ELISA assay is available. Other assay systems are based on the activity of HGF as SF (scatter factor). Proliferation of CCL-64 cells induced by HGF has been used also as an assay. The induction of IL11 by HGF in SaOS-2 cells has been used as a bioassay for HGF. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p>CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>This factor may be of clinical importance due to its involvement in tissue regeneration following hepatectomy. </p>

<h2>IL2RA</h2>
<p>[interleukin-2 receptor-alpha; IL2R-alpha; IL2 receptor-alpha] This is the approved gene symbol for one subunit of the receptor for IL2. The simple designation IL2R [interleukin-2 receptor] is used also. The receptor has been identified originally as TAC antigen. In older publications the has been referred to as TCGFR [T-cell growth factor receptor]. Because of disease associations with polymorphisms of the IL2RA gene, IL2RA is being referred to also as IDDM10. The mouse counterpart of IL2RA is known as Ly43 [lymphocyte antigen 43]. The rat counterpart is OX39. </p>
<p>In the nomenclature of CD antigens the receptor has been given the designation CD25. </p>
<p>The IL2RA gene has been cloned and characterized by Nikaido et al (1983), Leonard et al (1984), Ishida et al (1985), Leonard et al 1985). The IL2 receptor exists in 3 different forms: a high affinity dimer consisting of the alpha subunit IL2RA and the beta subunit (IL2RB), an intermediate affinity monomer (beta subunit), and a low affinity monomer (alpha subunit). IL2RA is not functional in IL2 internalization and signal transduction ((Gnarra et al, 1990). Signalling through the high and intermediate affinity forms requires a heterotrimeric complex formed by association with a gamma subunit (IL2RG; common gamma), which is shared also with receptors for other cytokines (Wang et al, 2005; Stauber DJ et al, 2006). </p>

<h2>IL12</h2>
<p>Interleukin-12. </p>
<p> ALTERNATIVE NAMES </p>
<p>CLMF (cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor); NKSF (natural killer cell stimulatory factor); TcMF (CTL maturation factor; see: CLMF); TSF (T-cell stimulating factor). See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL12 is secreted by peripheral lymphocytes after induction.IL12 is produced by activated hematopoietic phagocytic cells (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and by dendritic cells (Hsieh et al, 1993; Chan CW et al, 2006), but also by a variety of other cell types. The most powerful inducers of IL12 are bacteria, bacterial products, and parasites. IL12 is produced after stimulation with Phorbol esters or Calcium ionophore by human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The human lymphoblastoid cell line NC37 secretes large amounts of the uncomplexed 40 kDa subunit of IL12. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL12 is a heterodimeric 70 kDa glycoprotein (IL12-p70) consisting of a 40 kDa subunit (designated IL12B, IL12-beta, IL12-p40; 40 kDa subunit, 306 amino acids; 10 % carbohydrate) and a 35 kDa subunit (designated IL12A, IL12-alpha, IL12-p35; p35, 197 amino acids; 20 % carbohydrate) linked by disulfide bonds that are essential for the biological activity of IL12. IL12-p40 contains 10 cysteines and a binding site for heparin (see also: HBGF, heparin binding growth factors); p35 contains 7 cysteines. </p>
<p>p40 shows some homology with the extracellular domain of the receptor for IL6. p35 and IL6 probably are homologous. p40 has been shown to be a subunit of another composite cytokine, designated IL23. The p40 subunit can also form a homodimer, IL12-p80, which act as an IL12 and IL23 antagonist by competing at their receptors. </p>
<p>Lieschke et al (1997) have recently described the construction of bioactive murine and human IL12 fusion proteins combining the two IL12 subunits in a single molecule. This designer cytokine (see also: Muteins) retains antitumor activity in vivo. Anderson et al (1997) have described the construction of Flexi 12, a single chain protein retaining all of the biological characteristics of the dimeric recombinant IL12. </p>
<p>The p35 subunit of IL12 has been shown to heterodimerize with a protein known as EBI-3 (EBV induced gene-3). p28 is related to the p35 subunit of IL12 and is one subunit of the IL27 heterodimeric protein. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The gene encoding the p40 subunit of IL12 (IL12B; see also: IL12-p40) maps to human chromosome 5q31-q33 in the same region that also harbors other cytokine genes (see: 5q minus syndrome). The gene encoding the p35 subunit of IL12 (IL12A; see also: IL12-p35) maps to human chromosome 3p12-q13.2. The expression of the two genes is regulated independently of each other </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL12 receptor (CD212) appears to be a single protein of approximately 110 kDa. Up to 1000-9000 high affinity IL12 receptors/cell are expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by various mitogens for T-cells or by IL2. IL12 receptors are present on activated T-cells expressing CD4 and CD8 and on activated CD56(+) natural killer cells. Resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tonsillar B-cells, or tonsillar B-cells activated by anti-IgM/Dx, anti-IgM/Dx + IL2, or SAC + IL2 do not express the receptor. High affinity IL12 receptors are expressed constitutively on a transformed marmoset NK-like cell line, HVS.SILVA 40. </p>
<p>Binding of IL12 to its receptor can be prevented by monoclonal antibodies directed against the p40 subunit which therefore contains the binding site. The p40 subunit of IL12 shows homology with the extracellular domain of the IL6 receptor. For a virus-encoded homolog of the p40 subunit see also: (EBI-3: EBV induced gene-3). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL12 is not active in murine lymphocytes. Hybrid heterodimers consisting of murine p35 and human p40 subunits retain bioactivity on murine cells; however, the combination of human p35 and murine p40 is completely inactive on murine cells. Murine IL12 is active on both murine and human lymphocytes. </p>
<p>The p40 subunit of murine IL12 subunit p40 (IL12-p40) has been shown to specifically antagonize the effects of the IL12 heterodimer in different assay systems and to function as an endogenous specific inhibitor for the IL12 heterodimer (Mattner et al, 1993). Some cells, such as microglia and macrfophages, have been shown to produce the IL12-p40 subunit, but not IL12, under certain conditions (Constantinescu et al, 1996; Mottonen et al, 2002; Fernandez-Lago et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL12 stimulates the proliferation of human lymphoblasts following cell activation by phytohemagglutinin. IL12 activates CD56(+) NK-cells, and this activity is blocked by antibodies specific for TNF-alpha. IL12 promotes specific allogenic CTL reactions. IL12 synergizes also with anti-CD3 antibodies and with allogeneic stimulation in mixed lymphocyte cultures in inducing T-cell proliferation. </p>
<p>In peripheral lymphocytes of the Th1 T-helper cell type IL12 induces the synthesis of IFN-gamma and IL2, and TNF. TNF-alpha also appears to be involved in mediating the effects of IL12 on natural killer cells since the effects of IL12 are inhibited by an antibody directed against TNF-alpha. IL12 and TNF-alpha are costimulators for IFN-gamma production with IL12 maximizing the IFN-gamma response; the production of IL12, TNF, and IFN-gamma is inhibited by IL10. In Th2 T-helper cells IL12 reduces the synthesis of IL4, IL5, and IL10. </p>
<p>IL12 synergises with suboptimal amounts of IL2 in promoting the proliferation of mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood and in promoting the generation of LAK cells (lymphokine activated killer cells). Picomolar concentrations of IL12 are as effective as nanomolar concentrations of IL2 in augmenting the cytolytic activity of natural killer cells expanded in vivo by IL2. IL12 also acts as a co-mitogen and potentiates the proliferation of resting peripheral cells induced by IL2. </p>
<p>IL12 is involved probably also in the selection of immunoglobulin isotypes. At picomolar concentrations IL12 markedly inhibits the synthesis of IgE by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with IL4 also in the presence of antibodies directed against IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Murine IL12 has been shown to alter CD4(+) subset differentiation and to be involved in the induction of protective immunity against intracellular parasitic infections in mice. It cures mice infected with Leishmania major. </p>
<p>IL12 enhances myelopoiesis of primitive bone marrow progenitor cells induced by SCF (stem cell factor) and synergizes with colony stimulating factors (see: CSF) to induce proliferation. IL12 also has synergistic effects on more committed bone marrow progenitors, synergising with IL3, IL11, or IL3 plus SCF. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The biological consequences of IL12 deficiency have been studied in transgenic knock-out mice generated from ES cells. IL12 deficient mice are impaired but not completely lacking in the ability to produce IFN-gamma following endotoxin administration and to mount a Th1 T-helper cell response in vivo. Secretion of IL4 is enhanced, while proliferation and secretion of IL2 and IL10 are normal following antigen stimulation. Delayed type hypersensitivity responses in mutant mice are significantly reduced while the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is not compromised in the absence of IL12. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL12 is of potential clinical interest since it allows to reduce doses of IL2 required for the generation of LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells). This may reduce the toxicity of higher doses of IL2 used for Adoptive immunotherapy. IL12 may be useful in expanding an antigen-specific T-cell population, as the culture of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with IL12 and low-dose IL2 leads to proliferation only in response to an antigen co-signal. IL12 has been shown to augment natural killer-cell mediated cytotoxicity in a number of conditions, including patients with hairy cell leukemia. </p>
<p>The ability of IL12 to induce the synthesis of IFN-gamma and to stimulate the proliferation of resting peripheral cells may be of interest also. </p>
<p>IL12 has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of experimental tumors in vivo and to have anti-angiogenic effects in vivo, which are, at least in part, mediated by IFN-gamma. IL12 therefore seems to be a potential candidate also for the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent malignancies. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL12 can be assayed by its activity as NKSF (natural killer cell stimulatory factor) or CLMF (cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor). Human and porcine IL12 can be assayed in 10B10 cells. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. Murine IL12 can be measured in bioassays using the 2D6 cell line. </p>

<h2>IL16</h2>
<p>[Interleukin-16] This factor has been described originally as Lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF), which is produced by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells and acts as a chemoattractant for lymphocytes. The IL16 protein is derived from a much larger biologically inactive precursor (Baier et al, 1997; Bannert et al, 1996). Cleavage of bioactive secreted IL16 from its precursor is mediated by Caspase-3 (Wu et al, 1999). Bannert et al (1999) have cloned the murine gene. Keane et al (1998) have reported a high degree of structural and functional similarity between human and murine IL16. A high level of similarity at the amino acid sequence level is observed also between feline, human, and monkey IL16 (Leutenegger et al, 1998). Kurscher and Yuzaki (1999) have described the identification of NIL16 (Neuronal IL16) as a cytosolic long form of IL16 detected only in neurons. </p>
<p>Zhang et al (2001) have reported that the large proform of human IL16 (631 amino acids) is cleaved into two functional proteins, a C-terminal secreted cytokine and an N-terminal product, which localizes to the nucleus and affects the cell cycle. Chupp et al (1998) have shown that > 70 % of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells constitutively express IL16 protein, which is processed into bioactive secreted IL16 upon cell activation. </p>
<p>IL16 is secreted mainly by CD8(+) lymphocytes (Laberge et al, 1995; Schwab et al, 2001). The protein is produced by B-cells (Sharma et al, 2000; Kaser et al, 2000), neutrophils (Schwab et al, 2001), eosinophils (Laberge et al, 1999; Dunzendorfer et al, 2003; Lim et al, 1996), mast cells (Laberge et al, 1999; Middel et al, 2001; Rumsaeng et al, 1997), monocytes (Elssner et al, 2004), macrophages (Schwab et al, 2001; Reich et al, 2004), microglial cells (Schwab et al, 2001; Guo et al, 2004), dendritic cells (Kaser et al, 1999; Reich et al, 2002), lung epithelial cells (Yoshida et al, 2001; Arima et al, 1999; Little et al, 2003; Cheng et al, 2002; Bellini et al, 1993), keratinocytes (Frezzolini et al, 2004), thyrocytes (Gianoukakis et al, 2003), and fibroblasts from several tissues (Sciaky et al, 2000; Franz et al, 1998; Pritchard et al, 2004). Preformed bioactive IL16 has been shown to be released from CD8(+) T-cells, in contrast to CD4(+) cells, after activation with serotonin or histamine (Laberge et al, 1996, 1995; Gantner et al, 2002). </p>
<p>IL16 is a chemoattractant for a variety of cell types that express the cell surface antigen CD4 (Cruikshank et al, 2000), including CD4(+) T-cells (Cruikshank et al, 1994; Caufour et al, 2001; Hidi et al, 2000; Center and Cruikshank, 1982), Th1 cells (Lynch et al, 2003), dendritic cells (Kaser et al, 2000, 1999), monocytes (Cruikshank et al, 1987), macrophages (Laberge et al, 1999), eosinophils (Cheng et al, 2002; Rand et al, 1991, Ferland et al, 2004), Langerhans cells (Stoitzner et al, 2001). IL16 appears to signal via CD4 (Bandeira-Melo et al, 2002; Cruikshank et al, 1994). </p>
<p>Asadullah et al (2000) have implicated IL16 in growth and skin homing of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. </p>
<p>Mathy et al (200) have reported that CD14(+) CD4(+) monocytes and maturing macrophages, but not CD4(+) T-cells, secrete IL1-beta, IL6, IL15 and TNF-alpha in response to IL16 stimulation. IL16 upregulates expression of IL2 receptor and CD80, but downregulates CD4 and CD86 surface expression in monocyte-derived macrophages and also reduces expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 (Hermann et al, 1999). IL16 upregulates expression of IL2 receptor and CD83 in monocyte-derived dendritic cells but does not change levels of expression of CD4, CD80 and CD86 in these cells (Hermann et al, 1999). </p>
<p>IL16 has been shown to upregulate IL2 receptor (CD25) on CD4(+) T-cells (Cruikshank et al, 1994, 1987), and thus influences cell activation of these cells, which depends on IL2. Ogasawara et al (1999) have reported that IL16 suppreses mitogen-induced production of IL2 by CD4(+) T-cells. IL16 also induces the transient loss of responsiveness via the T-cell receptor (Cruikshank et al, 1996; Theodore et al, 1996). IL16 acts as both primer and modulator of T-lymphocyte growth (Wilson et al, 2004). </p>
<p>Bandeira-Melo et al (2002) have reported that IL16 promotes release of leukotrienes and IL4 from human eosinophils. </p>
<p>IL16 has been shown to suppress the replication of HIV and SIV (Baier et al, 1995). Idziorek et al (1998) have reported that recombinant human IL16 inhibits HIV-1 replication and protects against cell death by apoptosis. Amiel et al (1999) have reported that IL16 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication in cells from infected subjects and that serum IL16 levels drop with disease progression. Truong et al (1999) have reported that IL16 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 entry and replication in macrophages and in dendritic cells. </p>
<p>Van Drenth et al (2000) have reported that IL16, the natural ligand of CD4, causes desensitization of one of the chemokine receptors, CXCR4, which is a coreceptor for CD4 for binding of HIV-1 gp120 protein. Mashikian et al (1999) have reported that IL16 also causes desensitization of the CCR5 receptor. </p>
<p>Pinsonneault et al (2001) have reported that IL16 inhibits IL5 production by antigen-stimulated T-cells in atopic subjects. </p>
<p>IL16 derived from CD8(+) T-cells has been implicated in the induction of CD4(+) T-cell abnormalities in systemic lupus erythematosus (Lee et al, 1998; Sekigawa et al, 2000). Upregulation of IL16 expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation and could lead to increased secretion of other pro-inflammatory cytokines in Inflammatory bowel disease (Seegert et al, 2001). Hessel et al (1998) have reported that IL16 plays an important role in airway hyper-responsiveness and upregulation of IgE, but is not important for eosinophil accumulation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Franz et al (1998) have implicated IL16 in rheumatoid arthritis since IL16, produced by synovial fibroblasts, mediates chemoattraction for CD4(+) T-cells in rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p> IL16 is generally assumed to utilize CD4 as a receptor (Center et al, 1996). Liu et al (1999) have identified the CD4 domain required for IL16 binding and lymphocyte activation. However, Mathy et al (2000) have reported that CD4 is not required for the functional activity of IL16 in murine monocytes. Their observation that cells from CD4 knock-out mice are as responsive to IL16 as their CD4 wild-type equivalents and that the effects of IL16 cannot be inhibited by soluble CD4 in these mice suggests that another molecule acts as the major receptor. Stoitzner et al (2001) have reported also that IL16 supports the migration of Langerhans cells through mechanisms partly independent of CD4. </p>

<h2>IL18</h2>
<p>[Interleukin-18] The gene encoding this nonglycosylated protein of 24 kDa has been identified originally as IGIF (IFN-gamma inducing factor). It encodes an inducer of IFN-gamma production by T-cells (Okamura et al, 1995; Micalef et al, 1997) and natural killer cells (Tsutsui et al, 1996) that is a more potent inducer than IL12. Alternative designations are IL1-gamma and IL1F4. Human recombinant IL18 is marketed as Iboctadekin (GlaxoSmithKline). </p>
<p>The proteins from murine (192 amino acids) and human IL18 (193 amino acids) sources show 65 % homology. Rat and murine IL18 display 91 % homology (nucleotide and amino acid level). IL18 does not display sequence similarities to other known proteins but a survey of the sequence by fold recognition methods demonstrates that it belongs to the IL1 family of cytokines (Ushio et al, 1996). </p>
<p>IL18 lacks a classical signal sequence necessary for secretion (Okamura et al, 1995; Ushio et al, 1996; Gu et al, 1997). IL18 is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor protein that has limited biological activity. The proform of IL18 is processed by one of the caspases, Caspase-1, to generate the 18 kDa bioactive molecule (Gu et al, 1997; Ghayur et al, 1997). Other proteases such as neutrophil proteinase-3 (Myeloblastin) may provide activation pathways that are independent of caspases (Sugawara et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Kikkawa et al (2001) have demonstrated that monocytes and macrophages produce large amounts of various IL18 species. Some of them are inactive dimers while others have weak IFN-gamma inducing activity. IL18 type 2 is a fragment of IL18 that possesses little activity as an inducer of IFN-gamma. This variant is bound to IgM in plasma and is found at high levels in approximately 30 % of normal subjects (Shida et al, 2001). The authors suggest that this variant may play some roles in the development of Th2 cell responses involving IgE production in association with atopic lesions. </p>
<p>The human gene has been mapped to chromosome 11q22.2-q22.3 (Nolan et al, 1998). </p>
<p>IL18 is produced during the acute immune response by macrophages and immature dendritic cells. IL18 is expressed by a variety of immune and non-immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages (Okamura et al, 1995; Ushio et al, 1996), Kupffer cells (Okamura et al, 1995; Seki et al, 2001), T-cells and B-cells (Nakanishi et al, 2001); Klein et al, 1999), dendritic cells (Stober et al, 2001; Gardella et al, 2000; Stoll et al, 1998; de Saint-Vis et al, 1998), osteoblasts (Udagawa et al, 1997; Torigoe et al, 1997), epidermal keratinocytes (Stoll et al, 1997), intestinal epithelial cells (Takeuchi et al, 1997; Pizarro et al, 1999), corneal epithelial cells (Burbach et al, 2001), glucocorticoid-secreting adrenal cortex cells (Conti et al, 1997), astrocytes, and microglial cells (Conti et al, 1999; Suk et al, 2001). </p>
<p>Acute cold stress strongly induces IGIF gene expression in rats (Conti et al, 1997). rat IGIF has been shown to be expressed in the adrenal gland of reserpine-treated rats (Conti et al, 1997). Park et al (2001) have reported an enhanced IL18 expression in common skin tumors. </p>
<p>IL18 is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activities of IL18 appear to be species specific. An important function of IL18 is the regulation of functionally distinct subsets of T-helper cells required for cell mediated immune responses (Nakanishi et al, 2001). IL18 functions as a growth and differentiation factor for Th1 cells. IL18 upregulates FAS ligand mediated cytotoxic activitiy of murine natural killer cells (Tao et al, 1996; Tsutsui et al, 1996). IL18 is part of a complex regulatory circuit involved in causing cell death by apoptosis. The expression of the receptor for FAS ligand, FAS antigen, is upregulated by IFN-gamma (Watanabe-Fukunaga et al, 1992) that itself is induced by IL18. </p>
<p>IL18 is a pleiotropic cytokine. IL18 induces activated B-cells to produce IFN-gamma that inhibits IgE production (Yoshimoto et al, 1997). IL18 has been shown to strongly augment the production of IFN-gamma by T-cells and NK-cells (Micallef et al, 1996). The ability of IL18 to enhance IFN-gamma production by NK-cells is dependent on the presence of IL12 (Walker et al, 1999). IGIF enhances T-cell proliferation apparently through an IL2 dependent pathway (Micallef et al, 1996). </p>
<p>Park et al (2001) have shown that IL18 is an angiogenic mediator that induces migration of microvascular endothelial cells and causes tube formation by endothelial cells in a matrigel matrix in vitro. It also induces angiogenesis in vivo in a matrigel plug assay. </p>
<p>IL18 has been found to enhance also the production of GM-CSF. Udagawa et al (1997) have shown that IL18 produced by osteoblastic stromal cells acts via GM-CSF and not via IFN-gamma to inhibit osteoclast formation. </p>
<p>Morel et al (2001) have observed that IL18 induces the expression of the CXC-Chemokines IL8, MGSA, ENA-78 in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast. It does not appear to induce the production of MIP-1-alpha. </p>
<p>IL18 inhibits osteoclast formation via T-cell production of GM-CSF (Udagawa et al, 1997; Horwood et al, 1998, 2001). </p>
<p>By stimulating immune cells IL18 also exibits a strong antitumoral activity, protecting experimental animals against repeated challenges with tumor cells cells (Micallef et al, 1997). In an attempt of cancer gene therapy, Osaki et al (1999) have introduced the IL18 gene into murine tumors and observed a potent antitumor effects mediated by local expression of IL18. Kishida et al (2001) have reported that the simultaneous expression of IL18 and IL12 by engineered melanoma cells induces significant antitumor effects in mice. </p>
<p>A protective effect of IL18 against the development of chronic graft-versus-host disease in the mouse has been demonstrated by Okamoto et al (2000). Reddy et al (2001) have shown that the inhibition of Il18 accelerates mortality caused by acute graft-versus-host disease in a bone marrow transplant model and that is due to increased FAS antigen mediated donor T-cell apoptosis. Leung et al (2001) have demonstrated that IL18 activates human neutrophils and that IL18 administration promotes accumulation of neutrophils in vivo, whereas IL18 neutralization suppresses the severity of footpad inflammation following carrageenan injection. </p>
<p>Abnormal expression of IL18 has been observed in autoimmune non obese diabetic (NOD) mice and to be closely associated with development of diabetes (Rothe et al, 1997). Pizarro et al (1999) have detected increased IL18 mRNA and protein expression that intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells in Crohn's disease tissue express elevated levels of IL18. </p>
<p>IL18 mediates infection resistance against a variety of pathogens, mainly due to the induction of IFN-gamma expression. IL18 plays a critical role in the defense against intracellular bacteria, including Listeria, Shigella, Salmonella, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Biet et al, 2002). Liver damage in mice caused by treatment with Propionibacterium acnes and septic shock induced by challenge with lipopolysaccharides can be prevented by administration of anti-IGIF antibodies (Okamura et al, 1995). </p>
<p>IL18, together with other cytokines, may play a role in the development of hepatic metastases of melanoma in vivo through upregulating the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and melanoma cell adherence (Vidal-Vanaclocha et al, 2000). </p>
<p>IL18 appears to play a direct neuromodulatory role in synaptic plasticity and impairs long-term potentiation and NMDA receptor mediated transmission in the rat hippocampus in vitro (Curran et al, 2001). </p>
<p>The expression of functional IL18 and IL18 receptor on human atheroma-associated endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mononuclear phagocytes, and its ability to induce IFN-gamma expression in smooth muscle cells, suggests a paracrine pro-inflammatory role in atherogenesis (Gerdes et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Ogura et al (2001) have reported that IL18 stimulates CD4(+) T-cells and macrophages to secrete IL5, GM-CSF, IL6, and G-CSF in the absence of IL12, which in turn induces hematopoietic cell proliferation causing neutrophilia and eosinophilia in mice. </p>
<p>Wang et al (2001) have reported that vaccination with IL18 gene-modified, superantigen-coated tumor cells elicits potent antitumor immune responses. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Wei et al (1999, 2001) have generated transgenic knock-out mice lacking expression of IL18. These mice are viable and fertile. There are no evident histopathologic abnormalities. The animals are susceptible to infections by the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. Infected mice produce significantly lower levels of IFN-gamma and larger amounts of IL4 compared with similarly infected heterozygous or wild-type mice. Infections of knock-out mice with Staphylococcus aureus, are less severe than similar infections in wild-type mice. Mutant mice develop significantly more severe septic arthritis than control mice. This is accompanied by a reduction in the levels of antigen induced splenic T-cell proliferation, decreased synthesis of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but increased production of IL4. </p>
<p>Wei et al (1999, 2001) also have reported a reduced incidence and severity of collagen induced arthritis in mice lacking IL18 and that treatment with recombinant IL18 completely reverses the disease of the IL18 knock-out mice to that of the wild-type mice. </p>
<p>RECEPTORS </p>
<p>A functional component of the human receptor for IGIF has been identified in the Hodgkin's disease cell line, L428 (Torigue et al, 1997). The cells express approximately 18,000 binding sites/cell. The dissociation constant of IL18 binding to L428 cells is about 18.5 nM. The cloned receptor component was shown to be identical with IL1Rrp [IL1 receptor-related protein). Expression of the IL1Rrp cDNA in COS-1 cells has been shown to confer IL18 binding properties on the cells and the capacity for signal transduction. This receptor is being referred to now as IL18R1 [interleukin-18 receptor-1; IL18R-alpha] or IL18RA [interleukin-18 receptor-alpha].  </p>
<p>Debets et al (2000) have shown that a highly specific IL18 receptor is formed together with IL1RAPL [IL1 receptor accessory protein-like]. This receptor is the same as IL18RAP [IL18 receptor accessory protein], which is the approved gene symbol for a protein that has been described also as AcPL [accessory protein-like subunit]. The protein is being referred to also as IL18RB [IL18R-beta].  </p>
<p>Some of the bioactivities of IL18 are modulated by a secreted binding protein, IL18BP [IL18 binding protein]. </p>
<p>DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>Taniguchi et al (1997) have developed an ELISA (see also: cytokine assays) specific for human IL18 ELISA. This assay has a minimum detection limit of 10 pg/mL and does not react with heat-denatured human IL18. There is no cross-reactivity with other cytokines. Taniguchi et al (1998) have established also cells useful for bioassays of murine IL18 by transfection of the murine IL18 receptor gene into KG-1 cells. Konishi et al (1997) have described sensitive bioassays for human IL18 using the human myelomonocytic cell line, KG-1. </p>

<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL3 is produced mainly by T-cells following cell activation by antigens and mitogens, but also by keratinocytes, NK-cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, and monocytes. Some cell lines produce IL3 constitutively. Substances that inhibit the activation of T-lymphocytes such as glucocorticoids or CsA (Cyclosporin A) also inhibit the production of IL3. For the constitutive synthesis of IL3 see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). </p>
<p>IL3 may be associated with the extracellular matrix in the form of complexes with heparan sulfate/proteoglycan. It can thus be stored in a biologically inactive form but it may exert juxtacrine activities also. The molecular mechanisms underlying the release from extracellular matrix stores is still unknown. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>Human IL3 is a protein of 15-17 kDa (133 amino acids). It is synthesized as a precursor containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 19 amino acids. IL3 contains two putative glycosylation sites at positions 15 and 70 and contains a single disulfide bond (Cys16/84). The analysis of bacterial-derived recombinant IL3 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) shows that glycosylation is not required for the activity of IL3. </p>
<p>IL3 sequences are evolutionarily less well conserved. Human and murine IL3 show approximately 29 % homology at the protein level while murine and rat IL3 show approximately 54 % homology. IL3-alpha and IL3-beta are two isoforms of rat IL3. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL3 has a length of approximately 2.2 kb and contains five exons. The gene maps to human chromosome 5q23-31. Murine and human IL3 genes structurally resemble each other but at the nucleotide level the homology is approximately 49 %. The murine IL3 gene maps to chromosome 17. </p>
<p>The human IL3 gene is located in close vicinity to other cytokine genes, including those encoding GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL4 and IL5 The distance between the IL3 and the GM-CSF gene is approximately 9 kb with the IL3 gene on the 5'side of the GM-CSF gene. Deletions of the IL3/GM-CSF locus are observed frequently in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (see also: 5q minus syndrome). </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>IL3 receptors are expressed on macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, basophils, bone marrow progenitor cells, and various myeloid leukemia cells. </p>
<p>IL3/receptor complexes have a Kdis of 10**-9 - 10**-10 M. Binding of IL3 to its receptor causes specific phosphorylation of a 150 kDa membrane glycoprotein. </p>
<p>Biological activities are also detected at the concentration range of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M which suggests the existence either of other high affinity receptor conformations or other receptors. </p>
<p>The high affinity IL3 receptor is formed by aggregation of the IL3-specific subunit of the receptor with another subunit called GM-Rbeta which constitutes the larger subunit of the receptor for GM-CSF and is involved also as a subunit in the formation of IL5 receptors (see also: AIC2A). This subunit which is common to all three receptors is called also Beta c or common beta. In the nomenclature of CD antigens this common protein has been given the designation CD131. See also the Transgenic /Knock-out/Antisense Studies section of this entry for details on mice not expressing the common beta subunit of the receptor complex. </p>
<p>Binding of IL3 to its receptor causes the phosphorylation of the receptor and also of some other cytoplasmic proteins (p70, p56, p38) and also activates protein kinase C in IL3 dependent cell lines (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines). The non-receptor tyrosine kinase lyn has been implicated in IL3 mediated signal transduction processes (see also: PTK; protein tyrosine kinase). </p>
<p>For a protein involved in signal transduction see also: CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein). </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL3 are species-specific. The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL3 has been described. IL3 is a growth factor that establishes the link between the immune system and the hematopoietic system (see also: hematopoiesis). It supports the proliferation and development of almost all types of hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: CFU). In rhesus monkeys IL3 causes the expansion of all types of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL3 also supports the differentiation of early non-lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitor cells into colonies of granulocytes, macrophages, erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and mast cells (see also: Colony formation assay). IL3 also stimulates clonal growth of non-hematopoietic stromal cells in bone marrow cultures (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture). IL3 is one of the priming factors for hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and in vivo (see also: cell activation) that makes the cells responsive to later-acting factors such as Epo, GM-CSF and IL6. IL3 also induces the increased expression of receptors for colony stimulating factors (see: CSF). At pico- to nanomolar concentrations IL3 is a chemoattractant for eosinophils and also influences the chemotactic behavior of these cells in response to other chemotactically active factors (see also: Chemotaxis). </p>
<p>IL3 does not appear to be an obligatory factor in normal hematopoiesis. The athymic nude mouse (see also: Immunodeficient mice) which lacks T-cells responsible for IL3 production displays a normal pattern of hematopoietic development. In the lymphoid lineage IL3 supports the growth of preB-cells. </p>
<p>Experiments with an oncogene encoding a tyrosine-specific protein kinase show that the expression of the oncogene-encoded tyrosine kinase abolishes IL3 requirements (and also GM-CSF and IL4 requirements) in factor-dependent cells. The exact mechanism by which these factors regulate proliferation and differentiation is still unknown. </p>
<p>IL3 induces the proliferation of mast cells and macrophages and causes the synthesis of histamines by mast cells and phagocytosis in macrophages. In mast cells IL3 prevents the expression of MHC class 2 molecules normally induced by IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>IL3 induces the expression of complement factor C3a receptors in basophils at nanomolar concentrations. A transient stimulation by IL3 is required to make basophils responsive for further cell activation by IL8 which by itself does not possess histamine releasing activity. Tissue mast cells do not respond to IL3. In macrophages stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. IL3 significantly enhances the secretion of other cytokines including IL1, IL6 and TNF. In vitro IL3 also stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes. This observation has been made also in rhesus monkeys treated with recombinant IL3 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) but at present it is unclear whether IL3 is involved in skin reactions associated with the growth of keratinocytes and acanthosis. </p>
<p>IL3 also specifically induces the production of enzymes involved in cellular metabolism, differentiation and DNA/RNA metabolism. Among other things IL3 induces the expression of 20-alpha-steroid dehydrogenase and of histidine and Ornithine decarboxylase. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL3 in astrocytes have been studied in transgenic mice expressing a murine glial fibrillary acidic protein fusion gene. Chiang et al (1996) have shown that chronic CNS production of low levels of IL3 promotes the recruitment, proliferation and activation of microglial cells in white matter regions with consequent primary demyelination and motor disease. These features resemble those found in human inflammatory demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis and HIV leukoencephalopathy. </p>
<p>Robb et al (1995) have created transgenic knock-out mice with a null mutation of the gene encoding the common beta subunit (beta C) of the GM-CSF, IL3, and IL5 receptor complexes. Homozygous deletion mutants exhibit normal development and survive to young adult life. They develop pulmonary peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis. Eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone marrow of homozygous deletion mutants are reduced, while other hematological parameters are normal. Bone marrow cells from homozygous deletion mutants do not show high-affinity binding of GM-CSF, while cells from heterozygous animals show an intermediate number of high-affinity receptors. In clonal cultures of bone marrow cells derived from homozygous deletion mutants, even high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL5 do not stimulate colony formation (see also: Colony formation assay). Differences in the systemic clearance and distribution of GM-CSF between mutant and wild-type littermates are not observed. </p>
<p>Nishinakamura et al (1996) have crossed beta-c mutant mice with mice deficient for IL3. The double-mutant mice lacking all IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 functions are apparently normal and fertile. The animals show the same reduced numbers of eosinophils and a lack of eosinophilic response to parasites as beta-c mutant mice. The immune response of the double mutant mice to Listeria mono-cytogenes is normal. Hematopoietic recovery after treatment with Fluorouracil is also normal. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanism to produce blood cells that do not depend on the presence of IL3, GM-CSF, and IL5 (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells). </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL3 can be detected in bioassays employing responsive cell lines (see: AML-193; 32D; B6SUt-A; B13; Da; Ea3.17; FDCP1; GF-D8; IC-2; KMT-2; L138.8A; LyD9; MO7E; NFS-60; PT-18; TALL-103; TF-1; TMD2; UT-7). A sensitive ELISA test for IL3 is also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL3 alone or in combination with other colony stimulating factors (see also: CSF) or Epo is probably useful in the reconstitution of bone marrow and in stimulating erythropoiesis (see also: hematopoiesis). IL3 also appears a valuable substance in view of its ability to stimulate the proliferation of very immature hematopoietic progenitor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM, which can be enhanced even more by simultaneous administration of other factors such as GM-CSF. These effects can be exploited in the generation of stem cells, allowing stem cell separation and re-infusion into patients undergoing, for example, intensive chemotherapy. It may be useful also in the treatment of anemic patients with congenital defects such as BFU-E deficiency. IL3 appears to be of limited benefit in patients who are severely aplastic after autologous bone marrow transplantation and have very low levels of bone marrow progenitors. </p>
<p>In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, who frequently present with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia due to defective maturation of bone marrow cells initial phase I/II trials with IL3 have demonstrated an increase in the counts of neutrophils in 59 %, of counts of platelets in 34 %, and in counts of reticulocytes in 25 % of the patients. </p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that IL3 administered subcutaneously appears to be an interesting hematopoietic growth factor (see also: Hematopoietins) for reduction of chemotherapy induced myelotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. </p>
<p>IL3 is probably of major importance in the treatment of thrombopenias, secondary hematopoietic insufficiencies and certain types of refractory anemia. The administration of IL3 followed by subsequent course of IL6 greatly improves platelet counts. This combination, therefore, may allow an effective control of thrombocytopenias and severe bleeding frequently associated with this condition. </p>
<p>Some monocytic and myeloid leukemias the growth of which is inhibited almost completely by antibodies directed against IL3 have been described in the mouse These leukemias are characterized by the overexpression of the IL3 gene. In humans, however, such cases have not been described to date. A number of malignant myeloid and lymphoid leukemias respond to IL3. In vitro ALL blast cells can be made more responsive to cytotoxic drugs such as cytosine arabinoside by treatment with IL3. At present it is unclear whether this also occurs in vivo. </p>

See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL6 is produced by many different cell types. The main sources in vivo are stimulated monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Macrophages, T-cells and B-lymphocytes, granulocytes, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, mast cells, glial cells, and keratinocytes also produce IL6 after stimulation. Glioblastoma cells constitutively produce IL6 and the factor can be detected also in the cerebrospinal fluid. Human milk also contains IL6 (see: MGF, milk growth factor). </p>
<p>Cardiac myxomas and cervical and bladder carcinomas secrete large amounts of IL6 into the conditioned medium. Very high levels of IL6 are also detected in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but not with osteoarthritis. </p>
<p>Physiological stimuli for the synthesis of IL6 are IL1, bacterial endotoxins, TNF, PDGF, and Oncostatin M. In fibroblasts the synthesis of IL6 is stimulated by IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, PDGF, and viral infections. In thymic stromal cells the synthesis of IL6 can be induced by NGF. IL6 can also stimulate or inhibits its own synthesis, depending upon the cell type. For the constitutive production of IL6 see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of IL6 is induced by IL17. </p>
<p>IL6 is produced also in the anterior lobe of the pituitary and can be induced by bacterial endotoxins and all substances elevating intracellular levels of cAMP (prostaglandin E2, forskolin, cholera toxin). VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) also stimulates the synthesis of IL6 in the anterior lobe of the pituitary while Growth hormone releasing hormone is inactive. Macrolide antibiotics spiramycin and erythromycin stimulate the synthesis of IL6 in human monocytes following cell activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharides but not the synthesis of IL1 or TNF-alpha. </p>
<p>Glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of IL6 and IL4 or TGF-beta reduce its synthesis. The synthesis of IL6 by human alveolar macrophages is inhibited by IL4. </p>
<p>In serum IL6 is complexed with Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Alpha2M) which protects IL6 from cleavage by proteases and possibly functions as a transport protein. </p>
<p>The release of IL6 from isolated rat macrophages in culture is stimulated by Histogranin. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL6 is a protein of 185 amino acids glycosylated at positions 73 and 172. It is synthesized as a precursor protein of 212 amino acids. Monocytes express at least five different molecular forms of IL6 with molecular masses of 21.5-28 kDa. They mainly differ by post-translational alterations such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. </p>
<p>IL6 isolated from various cell types shows some microheterogeneity in its N-terminus. A 42-45 kDa form has been observed in plasma that is probably complexed with a carrier protein Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Alpha2M) Murine and human IL6 show 65 % sequence homology at the DNA level and 42 % homology at the protein level. For a truncated form of IL6 with antagonist activities see: tIL6. </p>
<p>IL6 is a member of a family of cytokines, which also includes LIF, CNTF, Oncostatin M, IL11, and CT-1. All known members of the IL6 cytokine family induce hepatic expression of acute phase proteins. </p>
<p>IL6-Delta-4 is an isoform constituting a splice variant of IL6 that lacks exon 4. The protein lacks two amino acids necessary for IL6 homodimerization and two of six amino acids required for interaction with IL6 receptor-beta. This isoform forms a stable complex with IL6 receptor-alpha. IL6-Delta-4 may compete with native IL6 for binding to the IL6 receptor-alpha and regulate IL6 bioactivities because of its inability to transmit IL6 receptor-beta-mediated signaling (Bihl et al, 2002). </p>
<p>Fischer et al (1997) have described the construction of a stable and highly bioactive designer cytokine (see also: Muteins) consisting of a fusion protein between IL6 and a soluble IL6 receptor. This hybrid, designated H-IL6 (Hyper-IL6), has been used for the expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells (see also: hematopoiesis, hematopoietic stem cells) and is useful in cases in which cells do not respond to IL6 but require a stable complex consisting of IL6 and a soluble IL6 receptor. </p>
<p>For a human recombinant fusion protein consisting of IL6 and IL2 see: CH925. For a virus-encoded homolog of IL6 see: viral IL6. </p>
<p>For a series of artificial cytokines derived from sequences of human IL6 and GCSF (termed Harlequin molecules) see: Muteins. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL6 gene has a length of approximately 5 kb and contains five exons. It maps to human chromosome 7p21-p14 between the markers D7S135 and D7S370. The murine gene maps to chromosome 5. The nucleotide sequences of IL6 and G-CSF genes resemble each other in a way suggesting a possible evolutionary relationship. </p>
<p>The IL6 gene promoter contains many different regulatory elements allowing the induction of expression by various stimuli, including glucocorticoids and cAMP (see also: gene expression). The NF-kappa-B binding site is responsible in non-lymphoid cells for the induction of the IL6 gene expression by IL1 or TNF. In lymphoid cells a factor related to the rel oncogene (IL6kB binding factor II) functions as a repressor that prevents the interaction of transcription factors with the IL6-kappa-B binding site. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL6 receptor is expressed on T-cells, mitogen-activated B-cells, peripheral monocytes and some macrophage- and B-cell derived tumor cell types. It is not expressed in resting B-cells but in resting T-cells. In hepatocytes the IL6 receptor expression is enhanced after treatment with IL6 or IL1. In several cell types the expression of the IL6 receptor is also enhanced by glucocorticoids. For the over-expression of the IL6 receptor see also: IAP (intracisternal A particles). The IL6 receptor gene maps to human chromosome 1q21. </p>
<p>The IL6 receptor is a strongly glycosylated protein of 80 kDa and a length of 449 amino acids. It has been designated CD126. It is synthesized as a precursor of 468 amino acids. The molecular structure resembles that of receptors for M-CSF, PDGF and IL1 in that the receptor contains an immunoglobulin-like sequence domain in the aminoterminal region of the extracellular receptor domain. </p>
<p>The intracellular domain of the IL6 receptor has a length of approximately 82 amino acids and does not show any homology to other proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. </p>
<p>Two different forms of the receptor have been described that bind IL6 with different affinities (Kdis = 10**-9 and 10**-11 M) and most likely arise by post-translational modification of the same receptor protein. </p>
<p>Biological activities of IL6 have been found also at concentrations of 10**-13 - 10**-15 M suggesting either the existence of other high-affinity receptor conformations or the existence of further receptor molecules with higher affinities. </p>
<p>IL6 receptor mediated signal transduction involves protein kinase C and also adenylate cyclase. </p>
<p>The complex formed between IL6 and its receptor associates with a transmembrane glycoprotein, gp130 (918 amino acids; cytoplasmic domain of 277 amino acids), that is involved in signal transduction. Binding of IL6 to its receptor leads to disulfide-linked homodimerization of gp130 and the associated activation of a tyrosine kinase as the first step of signal transduction. gp130 is expressed also in cells that do not express IL6 receptors. It has been found to be a component of other receptors, including those for IL11, LIF, Oncostatin M, and CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor), and CT-1. This explains why LIF, CNTF and IL6 share many biological activities although the factors themselves are not related to each other. A factor resembling STAT proteins, termed LIL factor, has been found to be involved in signaling pathways of IL6, and also of IL1 and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p>A soluble form of the IL6 receptor (see: IL6R-SUP; IL6 receptor soluble urinary protein) has been described also that also interacts with gp130. These soluble receptors probably function as physiological regulators of cytokine activities (see also: Cytokine inhibitors) by inhibiting receptor binding or act as transport proteins. Similar soluble receptors or binding proteins have been described also for IL1 (see: IL1ra, IL1 receptor antagonist), IL2, IL4, IL7, TNF-alpha, IGF, and IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Some cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells and neuronal cells, are only responsive towards a combination of IL6 and soluble IL6 receptor but not to IL6 alone. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>Human IL6 is biologically active in monkeys, rats, and mice. Murine IL6 is not active in human cells. </p>
<p>The plethora of biological activities is exemplified by the many different acronyms under which IL6 has been described. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine influencing antigen-specific immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It is one of the major physiological mediators of acute phase reaction. </p>
<p>In hepatocytes IL6 in combination with glucocorticoids induces the synthesis of metallothioneins and increases intracellular zinc levels, thus preventing CCL4 induced hepatotoxicity. </p>
<p>IL6 is a that promotes survival of cholinergic neurons in culture (see also: neurotrophic factors). Some neuronal cell lines can be induced to differentiate by IL6. For other neurotrophic factors see also: Neurotrophins. </p>
<p>IL6, like IL1, stimulates the synthesis of ACTH (Corticotropin) in the pituitary. Glucocorticoids synthesized in response to ACTH inhibit the production of IL6, IL1 and TNF in vivo, thus establishing a sort of negative feedback loop between the immune system and neuroendocrine functions. In astrocytes IL6 induces the synthesis of NGF. </p>
<p>IL6 is a B-cell differentiation factor in vivo and in vitro (see also: BCDF) and an activation factor for T-cells (see also: cell activation). In the presence of IL2 IL6 induces the differentiation of mature and immature T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells. IL6 also induces the proliferation of thymocytes and probably plays a role in the development of thymic T-cells. </p>
<p>IL6 is capable of inducing the final maturation of B-cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells if the cells have been pre-activated by IL4. In B-cells IL6 stimulates the secretion of antibodies to such a degree that serum IgG1 levels can rise 120-400-fold. </p>
<p>IL6 at concentrations of only 0.002 ng/mL is one of the major autocrine growth modulator for many human myelomas. The growth of these cells can be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against IL6. It can be inhibited also by the introduction of antisense RNA against IL6 or by IL4. The growth-inhibitory effects of corticosteroids on myeloma cells is probably due to the steroid induced reduction in the expression of IL5. The growth of human IL6 dependent myeloma cells (see also: Factor-dependent cell lines) can be inhibited also by IFN-gamma. IL6 may function also as an autocrine growth modulator for other tumor types, some of which have been found to secrete IL6 constitutively. IL6 has been shown to be an autocrine modulator of growth for in vitro cervical tumor cell growth. On the other hand IL6 blocks the growth of some solid tumors such as mammary carcinomas, cervical carcinomas, human lung cancer cell lines, histiocytic lymphomas, and melanomas. The growth-inhibitory effects are probably compensated by an IL6 induced reduction in cell-to-cell interactions, which also promotes increased metastasizing potential. </p>
<p>IL6 has been found to be expressed in murine blastocysts before hematopoietic differentiation hematopoietic growth factor. This suggests that IL6 also regulates the growth and development of trophoblasts or embryonic stem cells. </p>
<p>IL6 and IL3 synergise in vitro in promoting the proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL6 is also a thrombopoietin that induces the maturation of megakaryocytes in vitro and increases platelet counts in vivo. In murine, but not in human bone marrow cultures (see also: BMC, bone marrow culture) IL6 shows activities resembling those of GM-CSF. </p>
<p>Plasmacytoma cells produce IL6 and also the IL6 receptor. It has been suggested that these cells are stimulated in an autocrine fashion. A paracrine mechanism involving the presence of two different cell populations, one producing the factor and the other expressing the receptor, has been described also. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>The consequences of a deregulated expression of IL6 have been evaluated in transgenic mice expressing the human IL6 gene. These animals display dramatically elevated serum levels of IL6 and polyclonal IgG1. In addition one observes a massive plasmacytosis and all typical indications of a proliferative mesangial glomerulonephritis, which is probably due to the excessive overproduction of the cytokine. </p>
<p>Transgenic mice expressing the IL6 gene under the control of the human keratin gene promoter express IL6 in squamous epithelial cells. These mice are much smaller than normal mice and they also show a retarded development of the coat. An increased proliferation of epidermal cells and an infiltration of leukocytes are not observed. Other transgenic mice constitutively expressing murine IL6 at a level sufficient to induce IL6-responsive genes show less immature B-cells in bone marrow and expression of IL6-inducible liver genes, but the mice appear healthy and can easily be used for breeding. A high incidence of lymphomas associated with different tissues is observed only in mice older than 18 months. </p>
<p>Intracerebral overexpression of IL6 in transgenic mice has been shown to be associated with neurological syndromes the severity of which correlate with the levels of IL6 expression. These mice are characterized by runting, tremor, neurodegeneration, astrocytosis, angiogenesis, and induction of acute phase proteins production, suggesting a direct pathogenic role of IL6 in inflammatory, infectious, and neurodegenerative CNS diseases. </p>
<p>Brett et al (1995) have used a transgenic mouse model to express IL6 in brain astrocytes. They demonstrate an extensive break down of the blood brain barrier. Depending upon expression levels and age the animals show a leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrate, vacuolated astrocytic foot processes and endothelial abnormalities, parenchymal inflammation, gliosis, spongiform change, axonal degeneration and macrophage accumulation. </p>
<p>Kitamura et al (1995) have produced transgenic mice expressing human IL6. The animals showed histologically evident neutrophilia in the bone marrow. A Colony formation assay of bone marrow cells for CFU-C revealed increases in precursors of granulocytes and monocytes (see also: hematopoiesis). A decrease in osteoblast precursor cells was observed in 15 week old mice. Osteoclast numbers and bone resorption were also decreased. </p>
<p>The biological activities of IL6 have been studied also in IL6 deficient mice generated by targeted disruption of the IL6 gene in embryonic stem cells (see: ES cells). IL6 deficient mice of both sexes are viable and fertile and do not present any evident phenotypic abnormality. However, analysis of bone metabolism in females demonstrates that these animals have higher rates of bone turnover than control litter mates. In these mice, ovariectomy, which is known to result in increased bone turnover with bone resorption exceeding bone formation in normal animals, does not induce any change in either bone mass or bone remodeling rates. These results suggest that IL6 plays an important role in the local regulation of bone turnover and appears to be essential for bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. </p>
<p>The biological consequences of an IL6 gene disruption have been studied in mice generated from ES cells carrying a targeted deletion of the gene. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IL6 gene develop normally. The development of bone marrow and spleen B-cells in IL6 deficient mice appears to be normal. Numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T-cells are consistently reduced by 20-40 % as compared to controls, suggesting that IL6 is involved in T-cell proliferation. Thymocytes and T-cells show a normal expression pattern of T-cell receptor alpha, beta, gamma, and delta chains, CD4, CD8, and some other markers. </p>
<p>IL6 deficient mice fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The T-cell dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. IL6 deficient mice also show gross abnormalities with respect to the acute phase reaction in response to tissue damage or infection (see also: inflammation, wound healing). This response, however, is only moderately affected after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharides. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL6 can be detected in bioassays employing IL6 responsive cell lines (see: 7TD1; B9; CESS, KPMM2, KT-3; M1, MH60-BSF-2, MO7E; Mono Mac 6; NFS-60; PIL-6; SKW6-Cl4; T1165; XG-1). IL6 can be assayed also by its activity as a hybridoma growth factor (see: HGF). </p>
<p>Sensitive immunoassays and colorimetric tests are also available. An alternative and entirely different detection method is RT-PCR quantitation of cytokines. An ELISA assay exists for detecting the receptor-associated gp130 protein. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>The determination of IL6 serum levels may be useful to monitor the activity of myelomas and to calculate tumor cell masses. Low IL6 serum levels are observed in monoclonal gammopathies and in smouldering myelomas while IL6 serum levels are markedly increased in patients with progressive disease and also in patients with plasma cell leukemia. A blockade of the IL6 receptor or the inhibition of IL6 by monoclonal antibodies may be a way to delay or prevent the maturation of B-cells into plasma cells, suggesting also a new therapeutical concept involving cytostatic drugs coupled to monoclonal antibodies. </p>
<p>The deregulated expression of IL6 is probably one of the major factor involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. The excessive overproduction of IL6 (and other B-cell differentiation factors; see also: BCDF) has been observed in various pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, Lennert syndrome (histiocytic lymphoma), Castleman's disease (lymphadenopathy with massive infiltration of plasma cells, hyper gamma-globulinemia, anemia, and enhanced concentrations of acute phase proteins), cardiac myxomas and liver cirrhosis. The constitutive synthesis of IL6 by glioblastomas and the secretion of IL6 into the cerebrospinal fluid may explain the elevated levels of acute phase proteins and immune complexes in the serum. </p>
<p>IL6 probably also plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic polyarthritis (together with IL1 and IL8) since excessive concentrations of IL6 are found in the synovial fluid. </p>
<p>It has been suggested that IL6, due to its effects on hematopoietic cells, may be suitable for the treatment of certain types of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Pretreatment with IL3 and subsequent administration of IL6 has been shown to increase platelet counts considerable. A combination of these two factors could therefore be valuable for the effective control of thromocytopenias and the very severe complications (excessive bleeding) usually associated with this condition. In combination with other cytokines (for example, IL2) IL6 may be useful in the treatment of some tumor types. </p>
<p>Very high levels of IL6 in the cerebrospinal fluid are observed frequently in bacterial (up to 500 ng/mL) and viral meningitis (10 - 1000 ng/mL). The detection of elevated concentrations of IL6 in the urine of transplanted patients may be an early indicator of a graft-versus-host reaction. The detection of IL6 in the amniotic fluid may be an indication of intra-amniotic infections. In inflammatory intestinal diseases elevated plasma levels of IL6 may be an indicator of disease status. In patients with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis elevated urine levels of IL6 are also an indicator of disease status. </p>
<p>Monitoring of postoperative serum IL6 levels may be more helpful than monitoring of C-reactive protein levels for estimation of inflammatory status and early detection of an acute phase reaction. </p>
<p>The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL6 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts. Altered tumor cells expressing IL4 also increase systemic immunity. Mice vaccinated with transduced cells reject a subsequent challenge of non-transduced cells, and, in some cases, a pre-existing tumor (for cancer vaccines see also: Cytokine gene transfer). </p>
<p>Serum and urinary IL6 levels have been shown to be predicting factors of Kawasaki disease activity. </p>

<h2>IL8</h2>
<p>Interleukin-8. </p>

See also: individual entries for further information. </p>
<p> SOURCES </p>
<p>IL8 is produced by stimulated monocytes but not by tissue macrophages and T-lymphocytes. IL8 is produced also by macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, and a number of tumor cell lines. </p>
<p>In many cell types the synthesis of IL8 is strongly stimulated by IL1 and TNF-alpha. In human skin fibroblasts the expression of IL8 is enhanced by Leukoregulin. The interferon IFN-gamma can function as a costimulator. The synthesis of IL8 is induced also by phytohemagglutinins, concanavalin A, double-stranded RNA, Phorbol esters, sodium urate crystals, viruses, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The expression of IL8 from resting and stimulated human blood monocytes is upregulated by IL7. In chondrocytes the synthesis of IL8 is stimulated by IL1-beta (see: IL1), TNF-alpha and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. In human astrocytes the synthesis and secretion of IL8 is induced by IL1 and TNF-alpha. Glucocorticoids, IL4, TGF-beta, inhibitors of 5' lipoxygenase, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 inhibit the synthesis of IL8. IL8 is constitutively and commonly produced by various carcinoma cell lines and this synthesis may be related to the elevation of serum IL8 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells secretion of IL8 is induced by IL17. </p>
<p> PROTEIN CHARACTERISTICS </p>
<p>IL8 is a non-glycosylated protein of 8 kDa (72 amino acids). It is produced by processing of a precursor protein of 99 amino acids. Processing of this precursor by specific proteases yields N-terminal variants of IL8. One of the enzymes converting the 77 amino acid form to the 72 amino acid form has been identified as cathepsin L (see: IL8 converting enzyme). </p>
<p>AVLPR-IL8 is a truncated IL8 variant lacking the first five amino acids. This shortened protein is identical with FDNCF (fibroblast-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor). </p>
<p>Longer forms of IL8 (79 and 77 amino acids) and shorter forms (69 amino acids) have been isolated also from conditioned medium of lymphocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (see: MDNCF, monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factors and FINAP, Fibroblast-derived neutrophil-activating protein), Fibroblasts stimulated by IL1 or TNF (see: NAP-1, neutrophil-activating protein), and polyI: C-stimulated endothelial cells (see: LAI, leukocyte adhesion inhibitor). The predominant form of IL8 produced by endothelial cells (and also by anchorage-dependent cells and human glioblastoma cells) is the 77 amino acid variant. For an endothelial cell-derived IL8 variant ([(Ala)-IL8](77)) serving as an apoptosis inducing factor see also: HL-60 cell line. </p>
<p>The IL8 protein contains four cysteine residues participating in disulfide bridges (Cys-7/Cys-34; Cys-9/Cys-50). </p>
<p>A Leu25Tyr mutation of IL8, which introduces the conserved tyrosine residue present in CC-Chemokines has been shown to create a factor that bestows upon IL8 the property to act as a chemoattractant for monocytes and the ability to bind to the CCR1 chemokine receptor. A Leu25Cys mutation of IL8 introduces chemoattractant activity for monocytes and the ability to displace MIP-1-alpha from the CCR1 receptor. </p>
<p> GENE STRUCTURE </p>
<p>The human IL8 gene (SCYB8) has a length of 5.1 kb and contains four exons. It maps to human chromosome 4q12-q21. The mRNA consists of a 101 base 5' untranslated region, an open reading frame of 297 bases, and a long 3' untranslated region of 1.2 kb. The 5' flanking region of the IL8 gene contains potential binding sites for several nuclear factors including activation factor-1, activation factor-2, IFN regulatory factor-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, a glucocorticoid responsive element, and a heat shock element. </p>
<p> RELATED FACTORS </p>
<p>The proteins mig (monokine induced by gamma-Interferon) (see also: Monokines), PF4 (platelet factor-4), MGSA (melanoma growth stimulatory activity), and a number of several other factors belonging to the family of chemotactic cytokines known as Chemokines are related to IL8. </p>
<p> RECEPTORS </p>
<p>The IL8 receptor is a dimeric glycoprotein consisting of a 59 kDa and a 67 kDa subunit. It has been given the name CD128. It is expressed in many different cell types including those not responding to IL8. The receptor density is approximately 20000/cell in neutrophils and approximately 300/cell in T-lymphocytes. </p>
<p>The IL8 receptor is a member of a G-protein-coupled receptor protein family (see also: GPR9). There are at least two different IL8 receptor types. The type 1 receptor specifically binds IL8 (Kd = 0.8-4 nM). The type 2 receptor (Kd for IL8 = 0.3-2 nM) also binds the IL8-related factors MGSA (Melanoma growth stimulatory activity), GRO (see: MGSA), MIP-2 (see: MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein), and NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2). Both receptor genes map to human chromosome 2q35. For a protein highly homologous to the IL8 receptors see: EBI-1 (EBV induced gene-1) and ECRF-3. The MGSA/GRO/IL8/MIP receptor has been identified as CKR1, which is identical with the Duffy blood group antigen that appears to be a receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. </p>
<p>orf74 encoded by the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus KSHV has been shown to encode a protein with significant sequence homology to the high-affinity IL8 receptor (see also: Viroceptor). IL8 has been shown to bind to the virus-encoded viroceptor M3. </p>
<p> BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES </p>
<p>The activities of IL8 are not species-specific. Human IL8 is also active in rodent and rabbit cells. The biological activities of IL8 resemble those of a related protein, NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating protein-2). </p>
<p>IL8 differs from all other cytokines in its ability to specifically activate neutrophil granulocytes. In neutrophils IL8 causes a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels (see also: Calcium ionophore) and the release of enzymes from granules. IL8 also enhances the metabolism of reactive oxygen species and increases Chemotaxis and the enhanced expression of adhesion molecules. A pre-activation by IL3 is required to render basophils and neutrophils susceptible to further activation by IL8. IL8 alone does not release histamines. IL8 actually inhibits histamine release from human basophils induced by histamine releasing factors (see also: HRF), CTAP-3 (connective tissue activating protein-3), and IL3. IL8 is involved also in mediating pain. </p>
<p>IL8 antagonizes IgE production by human B-cells without induced by IL4, affecting IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, or IgA production. IL8 directly affects B-cells through a specific mechanism that is different from IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, or prostaglandin E2 </p>
<p>The intravenous administration of IL8 in baboons causes a severe, albeit transient, granulocytopenia, followed by a granulocytosis, which persists as long as sufficient IL8 levels are maintained. </p>
<p>IL8 is chemotactic for all known types of migratory immune cells (see also: Chemotaxis). IL8 inhibits the adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells (see also: cell activation) and therefore possesses anti-inflammatory activities (see also: LAI, leukocyte adhesion inhibitor). The 72 amino acid form of IL8 is approximately ten-fold more potent in inhibiting adhesion of neutrophils than the 77 amino acid variant. IL8 is a mitogen for epidermal cells. In vivo IL8 strongly binds to erythrocytes. This absorption may be of physiological importance in the regulation of inflammatory reactions since IL8 bound to erythrocytes no longer activates neutrophils. Macrophage-derived IL8 supports angiogenesis and may play a role in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumor growth, and wound healing that critically depend on angiogenesis. </p>
<p>Binding of IL8 to its receptor and bioactivities of IL8 are inhibited by a synthetic peptide, antileukinate. </p>
<p> TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Blockade of IL8 expression in some human melanoma cell lines by antisense RNA has shown that IL8 functions as an autocrine growth modulator for these cells. A participation of IL8 in macrophage mediated angiogenesis is suggested by the observation that IL8 antisense RNA blocks angiogenic activity induced by monocytes. </p>
<p>Simonet et al (1994) have studied transgenic mice overexpressing IL8. Elevated serum IL8 levels were found to correlate with increases in circulating neutrophils and decreases in L-selectin expression on the surface of blood neutrophils. Changes in the expression of the integrin-beta-2 integrins Mac-1 (CD11b) and LFA-1 (CD11a) on peripheral blood neutrophilswere not observed. Expression of L-selectin on bone marrow neutrophils and their precursors was normal. The accumulation of neutrophils was observed in the microcirculation of the lung, liver and spleen. Neutrophil extravasation, plasma exudation or tissue damage were absent. Migration of neutrophils into the inflamed peritoneal cavity was severely inhibited. </p>
<p> DETECTION AND ASSAY METHODS </p>
<p>IL8 can be detected in assays measuring the migration of buffy coat leukocytes from agarose blocks. Sensitive immunoassays are also available. For further information see also subentry "Assays" in the reference section. For further information on assays for cytokines see also: bioassays, cytokine assays. </p>
<p> CLINICAL USE AND SIGNIFICANCE </p>
<p>IL8 may be of clinical relevance in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated concentrations are observed in psoriatic scales and this may explain the high proliferation rate observed in these cells. IL8 may be also a marker of different inflammatory processes. </p>
<p>IL8 (and also IL1 and IL6) probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic polyarthritis since excessive amounts of this factor are found in synovial fluids. The activation of neutrophils may enhance the migration of cells into the capillaries of the joints. These cells are thought to pass through the capillaries and enter the surrounding tissues thus causing a constant stream of inflammatory cells through the joints. </p>
<p>Human recombinant IL8 (see also: Recombinant cytokines) has been shown that the lesion responsible for defective functions of neutrophils in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome can be restored without stimulating myeloid progenitor cells. IL8 may be able, therefore, to reduce the risks of lethal infections in these patients without the potential risk of stimulating leukemic clones. </p>

<h2>MIF</h2>
<p>This term has multiple meanings: </p>

<p> _____________________________________________________________________________  (-4-) migration inhibition factor, migration inhibitory factor, macrophage inhibition factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MMIF) </p>
<p>An operational definition for factors that inhibit in vitro the migration of macrophages out of capillary tubes or small pieces of tissue (see also: Motogenic cytokines). Many proteins have been described to possess MIF activity, including TNF, IFN-gamma, IL1, IL2, GM-CSF (see also: LIF (leukocyte migration inhibitory factor). The proteins known as MRP-8 and MRP-14 (MIF-related protein) are MIF-related proteins that are recognized by some monoclonal antibodies directed against MIF activities. They are related to Calgranulins. </p>
<p>Another protein, called MIF-1, with MIF activity is secreted by a T-cell hybridoma. Another biochemically uncharacterized migration inhibitory factor is F5MIF-2. Another factor influencing the chemotactic behavior of neutrophilic macrophages (see also: Chemotaxis) is HDLF (Hodgkin-derived leukocyte factor). In addition there are many other biochemically uncharacterized factors with MIF activity that cannot be blocked by antibodies against known cytokines and that are therefore probably distinct factors. </p>
<p>MMIF has been cloned and has been shown to be a major secreted protein released by anterior pituitary cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides. It is identical with Sarcolectin binding protein. Pituitary-derived MIF contributes to circulating MIF present in the post-acute phase of endotoxinemia (see also: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome). Recombinant murine MIF (see also: Recombinant cytokines) greatly enhances lethality when co-injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharides and anti-MIF antibodies confer protection against lethal endotoxinemia. One particular factor with MIF activity is found also in chicken murine and human embryonic eye lenses (see: 10K protein). The human gene for this factor has been mapped by Budarf et al (1997) to chromosome 22q11.2. </p>
<p>A 12 kDa factor of 115 amino acids that also inhibits the migration of macrophages is produced by antigen-stimulated T-cells. These proteins show extensive sequence homology with each other and with a rat liver protein, designated TRANSMIF, a murine protein designated GIF (glycosylation inhibiting factor), and a mouse delayed-early response gene, designated DER6 [delayed early response gene 6]. These highly homologous proteins, sharing sequence homologies of up to 98 %, are structurally related to the theta-class of Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), a subclass of GSTs thought to be the most ancient evolutionary GST class. All proteins have retained a glutathione binding domain and demonstrate transferase activity. GSTs protect against xenobiotic chemicals by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione, which renders them non-toxic. Mouse, human and chicken macrophage migration inhibitory factor has been found to be highly homologous to rat liver 13k protein. </p>
<p> The receptor for MIF has been shown to be CD74 (Leng et al, 2003). The receptor complex uses CD44 as a signaling coreceptor (Shi et al, 2006). </p>
<p> MIF is known as a mediator of cellular immunity with specific effects on the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. The expression of MIF activity correlates well with delayed hypersensitivity and cellular immunity in humans and MIF is now recognized as a principal cytokine modulating T-cell / macrophage interactions in the expression of delayed hypersensitivity and acquired cellular immunity. Recombinant human MIF is responsible for the specific activation of macrophages to kill intracellular parasites such as Mycobacterium avium and Leishmania donovani. </p>
<p>Recombinant human MIF has been shown to activate macrophage expression of NO, a potent antimicrobial agent that is produced by the NO synthase mediated oxidation of terminal L-arginine guanidine nitrogen atoms. </p>
<p>Recombinant human MIF upregulates expression of genes encoding HLA-DR and IL1-beta (see: IL1) and elaboration of IL1-beta by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human recombinant MIF can also activate cultured human peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to become cytotoxic for tumor cells in vitro. MIF also induces macrophages to produce TNF-alpha and IL1-beta (see: IL1). MIF also stimulates nitric oxide production by macrophages primed with IFN-gamma. </p>
<p>Administration of soluble bovine serum albumin or human immunodeficiency virus 120 kDa glycoprotein to mice in the presence of recombinant MIF together with incomplete Freund's adjuvant induces a strong T-cell proliferative response comparable to that of complete Freund's adjuvant. Recombinant MIF also increases antibody production, especially of IgG1 and IgM, in mice. MIF may be useful, therefore, as an adjuvant in the development of vaccines. </p>
<p>MIF activity can be detected in the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The expression of MIF at sites of inflammation also suggests a role for the mediator in regulating the function of macrophages in host defense. </p>
<p>For a homolog of MIF encoded by a parasite see also: Bm-MIF. </p>
<p>TRANSGENIC ANIMALS, KNOCK-OUT, AND ANTISENSE STUDIES </p>
<p>Takahashi et al (1998) have investigated the expression of MIF in a colon cancer cell line (colon 26 cells) and its correlation with cell proliferation. Sublines from tumors obtained by serial transplantation in mice showed a significantly higher in vitro cell proliferation rate than the parent cell line and also showed higher levels of expression of MIF protein and mRNA. Transfection of antisense RNA against MIF into the parent cell line suppressed cell growth significantly. The authors point out that MIF may work as a growth factor for tumor cell growth and may be involved in the mechanism of metastasis. </p>
